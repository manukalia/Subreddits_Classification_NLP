Who else would love to see Shriv appear in Epeisode IX?,"We all know Lando will be in the next star wars movie and (as far as I know) his latest appearance in canon was the battlefront 2 campaign.

And get Dan Donohue who played him brilliantly to voice him again, maybe even put him in costume.

It's just wishful thinking I guess but I'm a huge fan of that character and would love to see more.","Who else would love to see Shriv appear in Epeisode IX?

"For those of you disillusioned with Star Wars in the direction it is taking under Disney, I have a question:","What would have to happen to turn around your opinion on the sequel trilogy? I'm not talking about silly things like ""remove TLJ from cannon"" or ""Kill off Rey at the beginning of Ep 9.""

I mean genuine suggestions. What would you want to see as a satisfying conclusion to Luke, Rey and Ben's character arcs taking into account the events so far? How would you end the Skywalker series in a way that redeems the flaws of TLJ?

I personally have a very mixed opinion on that movie. On the one hand the visuals and designs are amazing, the acting is solid and the plot itself isn't terrible when looked at from a distance, it's the execution that was poor. Luke's arc for me is disappointing but understandable at the same time, I wanted an OP Jedi master but it made sense for him to pass on the failures of the Jedi to future generations so they don't make the same mistakes.","For those of you disillusioned with Star Wars in the direction it is taking under Disney, I have a question: What would have to happen to turn around your opinion on the sequel trilogy?

Something I want to see in future star wars,"Ships. The last 2 movies have been good for my nostalgia, in showing the Milineum falcon, TIE Fighters, X-wings all that Jazz. But my favorite part of the prequels, and when I watched the original trilogy, was seeing new ships that made me say ""wow!"" And ""oooo!"" And even ""pretty!"" And these last 3 movies didn't do that for me. The rogue one movie got away with it in my book by showing me a new droid with K2SO. Maybe I'm the only one, but I hope to see a new style of starship in the newest installment of the franchise. Also, if there are any, I'd love to see some people make fanart of ship designs that could be in a starwars movie. Unfortunately I am not very artistic. I'd just end up drawing stick figures, but if anyone sees any fanart stuff like that, then please comment or private message me that stuff. That's the end of my rant about starships!

We Really Need a Game of Throne‚Äôs Style Show About the Mandalorians,"I know the new show is about a Mandalorian away from Mandalore doing his own thing. But after rewatching Rebels and currently doing a rewatch of Game of Thrones the potential a Mandalorian themed show like Game of Thrones would be awesome.

Have it almost exclusively set in Mandalorian space with Mandalore and Concordia and Concord Dawn and Krownest. Bring back some other Mandalorian planets from legends like Phindar and Ordo and Mandallia etc.

We could see the clans and houses. Like House Vizsla with Clan Wren and Clan Saxon under them. Clan Fett and Clan Skirata. House Kryze as well.

It would be absolutely amazing seeing a similar set up showing the different houses and clans and how they fight one another. I think it would work perfect if it was nothing during any other event we have seen or heard of before so like before the movies but not during the Mandalorian wars either. A new time period never explored in Mandalorian history. Something like this would be huge and I don‚Äôt see how anyone wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it","We Really Need a Game of Throne‚Äôs Style Show About the Mandalorians I know the new show is about a Mandalorian away from Mandalore doing his own thing.

Why were the mandalorians afraid of the empire?,The mandalorians are the one group of people that you would think wouldn't put up with imperial oppression but instead they cowered at the very mention of the empire.  Why were the mandalorians so afraid of the empire.  During the mandalorian  wars they conquered most of the outer rim and nearly brought the republic to it's knees.  And yet they're afraid of the empire.  That doesn't make much sense.  True the mandelorian wars was almost four thousand years before the films.  But they don't seem to have changed that much since then.  Of course eventually they tell the empire where they can stick it but only after the empire has been around for almost two decades.

How to run a planetary blockade,We see in rebels that when they go up against a planetary blockade they usually lose.  There is a really simple way to get past a planetary blockade that they seem to be overlooking.  Delay dropping out of hyperspace until your in the atmosphere.  Han solo did this in the force awakens.  So why isn't this used more often.  True you risk hitting a star destroyer but it's far more likely you would crash into the ground.  Still the odds are better then taking on a group of star destroyers head on.  As desperate as the rebels are you would think you would see them use strategies like this.  As for getting past a blockade after leaving a planet's surface there is way to do it.  Do a blind jump into hyperspace.  Space is mostly empty so the chances of you hitting something are negligible.  Drop out of hyperspace after a few seconds and then calculate your next jump and be on your way.  So I just find it ridiculous that the rebels would try to engage imperial ships on the blockade instead of using these methods of getting past them.,How to run a planetary blockade We see in rebels that when they go up against a planetary blockade they usually lose.

Please help: Star Wars Micro Machines,"Hey all! My students are planning a Star Wars themed prom this year. For the centerpieces they need some Star Wars micro machines. Would anyone know where to find a whole lot of them? We need about 50-60.

Fuel has been a plot point before. Hell, it's been an important one. The obvious one that comes to mind is after Qui-Gon and company escape Naboo and need to ""refuel and repair"".

Literally, the only reason Anakin Skywalker is discovered is because they were leaking fuel. I'd say that's kinda important.

It seems to me that Sir Christopher Lee played him as still clinging, in part, to the respectability he had in the Jedi order and that it was him who had the moral high ground and the Jedi's who had lost their way. Corey Burton seems to have Dooku fully embrace villain status. If you compare Lee vs Burton speaking the line, ""I've been looking forward to this"", Lee's sounds like he's been looking forward to the sport aspect of it where as Burton's is positively sinister, sounds like he is trying to intimidate them and that he will take great pleasure in cutting them apart.

Is it just me or does ryloth seem a lot more underdeveloped and primitive in the new EU compared to Legends?,"I really started thinking of then when I was reading Bloodline and they were talking about how they were so poor/put down that they had to keep all of their information on bark, leather, and paper. Their was also mention of them having to buy most of their ships and resources from other planets. 

Ryloth hasn't appeared that many times in the NEU and the rendering limitations of Rebels and TCW could be to blame but even when we see their cities/towns they are small one room adobe huts with not much in them. Though again this could just be a rendering thing where models are really simple and their isn't much environmental clutter. 

Idk, I just feel like while they were still under the thumb of the Hutts in Legends they were shown to be a little more on par with the rest of the galaxy instead of really far behind. Even tattooine seems more advanced. 

I know the Hutts had more control over Ryloth in the NEU than they did in Legends so maybe that had something to do with it.

Also while I can not find it on wookieepedia I feel like their was something that changed when they came to the Republic in the NEU vs Legends. It said about three thousand years ago meaning no Mission Vao or Tott Doneeta or any other twilikes running around in the old republic.  

IDK part of me feels like they have been turned into some undeveloped third world..world to me. But their is so little to really go on its hard to tell. What do you guys think?  I mean looking at the Republic Comics or their appearances in things like the X-Wing series they seem like any normal advance planet in  the rest of the universe but in the new EU they seem like they are technologically undeveloped and the only tech they have come some off-world but we really only seen them in the Clone Wars and Rebels so far

I would support NO TRAILER for EP IX... (or at least no substantive one),"I am sure that this will get lots of down-votes, but I want to make a case for it...

I believe that LucasFilm should not give the title of Episode IX and not release a trailer other than a spot that maybe shows shots from the other movies (I think Endgame did this in one of their spots).  This sounds crazy, but look at the gaming space - Apex Legends (which is technically the third game in the Titanfall series) is one of the biggest games right now. It was NOT announced, marketed, or promoted in any way shape or form (and a leak 48 hours before hand doesn't really count). They did this because they wanted to avoid the negative internet space, speculation machine or hot take trailer reviews. You could play the game for free and just see if you liked it without any pre-conceived notions.

&amp;#x200B;

Can you image a Star Wars experience where you literally have no idea what to expect other than the universe its set in and the characters on the screen.  It would really take Star Wars back to its roots.  I was a kid in 1977 and I didn't see a trailer or watch an ad...my cousins met me when I got out of my parents' car at my grandmothers house in June '77 and said ""YOU GOTTA SEE THIS MOVIE....WE'RE GOING AGAIN TOMORROW"" - we did and it was amazing!

Basically they should take the approach of telling fans: ""You know you are going to see it...so come see it and experience it for the first time together and leave the rumors, theories, and preconceived notions behind""","I would support NO TRAILER for EP IX...

Empire at War: Galaxy on Fire,"There seemed to be mild interest for this, so I did this. I played for like thirty minutes. 

First off, this is a compilation mod called New Jedi Order. It's on both moddb and steam workshop. So you can find it there. 

Second, the point of this was to further test the waters, see if I could get more feedback. I chose the New Republic for this play through because they are the most generic. 

But I didn't go for long for a couple reasons. 1) I want you guys to tell me what you think the strategy should be and 2) if you would rather see a different faction done, I didn't want to get too far in and have to start over. 

Again, the factions are 

New Republic

Why I think the saga will end on Tatooine.,"I believe the saga‚Äôs final moments will close on the planet where it all began. While Rey is awesome and I love her character, this story is hardly hers. Lest we forget this saga is the Skywalker story and tatooine is the most important planet in the entire saga.
No matter the fate of Luke, Ben solo, Rey, or leia, It only makes sense for the story to come full circle. I have a feeling it will be a special moment between Ben and Luke and I‚Äôm crossing my fingers for Hayden Christensen.


I just think it‚Äôd be a nice, poetic close to the Skywalker story.

Thirty Years,"One of the major complaints about the sequel trilogy I see is that it undermines the happy ending of RoTJ and what the original characters accomplished. While I understand where that is coming from, there is something that must be kept in mind - there was 30 years of peace. Or at least 30 years without open conflict and without the Empire.

For context, from the start of the Clone Wars to the fall of the Empire was only 27 years.

That's an entire generation of children who grew up free from that terror. That means something.

Yes, tragedy would eventually strike in the personal lives of Han, Luke and Leia, and for the galaxy at large in the form of an invading First Order, but later tragedy doesn't undermine what came before. Joy doesn't retroactively become meaningless if it's followed by pain.

Even now, while the First Order may be currently waging war against the galaxy, it would be wrong to say the Empire has returned in any way. Shooting up a town doesn't make you the mayor, especially when people are shooting back. At best they're an invading/occupying military force which literally just arrived. 

Basically while RoTJ may not be the happily ever after, fairy tale ending people thought, but it still matters. It was a victory, the effects of which are still felt today.","Thirty Years One of the major complaints about the sequel trilogy I see is that it undermines the happy ending of RoTJ and what the original characters accomplished.

Its interesting how much of the background of the PT changed between the Thrawn Trilogy and TPM,"Their was a interesting post on here yesterday asking people what they thought the changes would be if the PT was produced in the 80's instead of where they were in our timeline. And most people seemed to focus on the CGI (or lack there of) and how the characters would look. 

But what I find most interesting is how very different the PT its self would be on the large scale. When Zhan was writing Heir to the Empire he wasn't just pulling ideas out of thin air but referencing things that George had said to him or said in interviews or that could be gleamed from the movies. 

I mean the idea that the clones are the good guys is one of the largest changes. The Clone Wars instead of being named after who the Republic* was fighting is named after its defenders. The cloners are now the good guys (well at least being paid to work for the good guys) instead of being a rogue group/groups fighting against the Republic. 

I have an astrex next to Republic because their is even things that make it seem like the Empire may have been around for a longer time and that the Inquisition of the Jedi was a more drawn out process. A good example of this is the Lictor class duengon ship in Dark Empire. The background lore on this ship in the comics guide book makes it seem like the process of destroying the order was a much longer drawn out process than what we got in either canon and that the Inquisitors were a larger organization. OR at least that their were more darksiders in existance working for the empire. Maybe the Republic transformed into the Empire during the war instead of at the end of it and started to get harsher with the Jedi going into hiding and being slowly tracked down and killed. 

We also of course have other more personal changes when it comes to character relationships. Anakin only meets Owen once in the PT and Owen didn't even know Ani when he left with Qui-gon not obi wan. Which would be another change, good bye to that character. Also hello padme not dying in child birth. 

Their are some other things that would be hard to tell. For example would the Jedi and Sith be more like their TotJ era versions or were  the PT era always meant to be seen a misguided. We will never know how much truly changed but looking at the works released and the statements made around this time it would have been a very different universe.

How to defeat the empire,I've been watching star wars rebels and the only conclusion I can come to is that the empire is really incompetent.  Otherwise they would have stopped the rebellion a long time ago.  The rebels do pretty well against the empire but there is room for improvement.  First of all getting into a lightsaber duel with an inquisitor or god forbid vader is probably suicide.  The best thing to do is to be prepared.  Use a slug thrower because a light saber won't be able to block it.  At most it will turn the slugs into molten metal.  Also it can't hurt to wear armor made from either cortosis or mandelorian iron.  If your really smart you would have a layer of each one just to be safe.  Another thing that baffles me is that the rebels don't take advantage of hyperspace ramming.  We saw what that could do when they rammed snoke's cruiser in the last jedi.  And that wasn't even at they're top speed.  They're ships are fast.  Imagine an x-wing ramming into the bridge of a star destroyer in hyperspace at they're top speed.  They usually lose a bunch of they're star fighters when they engage the empire anyway.  Why not put them to better use.  Or what they could do is build a fleet of small unmanned drones with hyperdrives to ram into imperial star destroyers at faster then light speeds.  They wouldn't be as hard to build as actual star fighters and they could conserve they're pilots for when they're really needed.   Another thing they could do is find some old battle droids and reprogram them to fight the empire.  They run into battle droids a few times in rebels.  They were shut down after the clone wars but they're still out there.  Even better if they have the resources they could build they're own droid army.  Also when it comes to inquisitors they should hire bounty hunters to go after them.  A skilled bounty hunter like boba fett wouldn't have much trouble taking down an inquisitor.  Vader would be a different story though.  So the rebel alliance could really benefit from some out of the box thinking.  ,How to defeat the empire I've been watching star wars rebels and the only conclusion I can come to is that the empire is really incompetent.

Imagine the best Star Wars game ever,"When I think Star Wars I imagine a vast open universe where you can create your own character with your own morals, alliances, and abilities 

You would start of creating your own character, you would choose a Race, Gender, Voice and then an allegiance 

It would take place during the Prequel Era Of Star Wars and you can choose multiple roles 

Jedi, Sith, Droid, Clone Trooper, Bounty Hunter, and Senate, And each role would effect your gameplay and story 

As a Jedi you must master the force and learn new abilities and tricks so that you can find your way around situations easy way or the hard way depending on your skill set, you must also fight the urge to turn into a Sith and the story will constantly make things harder for you the more you follow the rules, and Sith tactics will be tempting as they are much easier to get through. As a Jedi you just also create your own Lightsaber, their are many Lightsaber types, Light-Wipes, Duel Wielding Lightsaber, Double Edged Lightsabers, not only can you choose the color, type, and the handles which effect the stats of the Lightsaber but you can also choose stances that effect your basic combos and attacks, some stances are slow but strong but with the right Lightsaber handle you can balance this out, all the stances will be based on official Star Wars lore. You can also take on Padawan of your choosing 

The Sith are very similar to the Jedi in many ways, all their Lightsaber combat is the same, but as a Sith you have access to different abilities, but this also works vis verses as things like the Jedi Mind Trick are no longer at your disposal, but Force Lightning And Force Chokes are yours for the taking, as a Sith you can also use influence, but targeting younger Jedi and prompting them to join you in the Darkside, you can even take on Apprentice as can the Jedi take on Padawan.


As a Clone Trooper you must pick your the Division first your choices are the ARC Troopers, 501st Legion, Domino Squad, 104th Batallion, 7th Sky Trooper, 91st Reconnaissance, And the ARF Troopers, depending on your Division is choosing your teammates, you will be introduced to a small cast of Soldiers and grow to care for them as your friends, you will be guided by a leader but as you become more and more experienced you will go up the rankings until you become a Commander in which it it your duty to command your team and lead them into battle, if your a bad leader who fails in battle on multiple occasions their will be consequences, your team could die and you can lose the people and soldiers you care about, you can even from bad relationships with your solders and even your Jedi Commander. Not something you want

Episode 7 alternate opening.,"Imagine if Ep 7 opened with Luke and Leia arriving to a planet to speak to a delegation about joining the republic. Only to walk into a first order trap. 

Somewhat mirrors Ep 1.

They know they need help in fighting the new enemy and Luke turns to his new recruits, including Rey and Kylo Ren. It's been hinted that Kylo has another agenda and at the end of the movie Kylo turns on Luke to join the First Order.

Now, this us just some fanboy fan fiction,  but I'm already more interested in this sequel story than the one we have. 

I wish we'd gotten the big 3 together again. The more time passes thr less I love the sequels and appreciate l, even with their flaws, the prequels.","Episode 7 alternate opening.

Something I liked about Return of the Jedi...,"...was the Sail Barge fight. While it's disconnected from the main conflict of the series, it sticks out to me. Most of Empire and Jedi take place with the cast divided. In this scene, though, we have all the heroes doing their thing in one big action scene. Add in the bombastic John Williams soundtrack and it becomes a highlight of the series for me.

After TLJ took place with the characters on separate adventures, I'm hoping for a moment like this in SW9. Either a big ""we're back"" action scene in the first act, or one triumphant final battle to wrap up the trilogy.","Something I liked about Return of the Jedi... ...was the Sail Barge fight.

Something on my mind that I want to share,"I just finished watching the clone wars episode, Ghost of Mortis. I haven't been the biggest star wars fan, and I only started watching this show because Cosmonaut Variety Hour had a video that recommended this show. I usually only watch shows if it has good writing, and clone wars definitely is one of them.

Little spoilers below.

To quote Marcus from the channel, ""Anakin Skywalker is a fucking hero."" And yeah, he's a real hero. And just like what Marcus said, it's really heartbreaking to see how he became a monster that is Darth Vader. Anakin was a likable person, he did as best as he could as a Jedi to save as many people as he can, even if it means using questionable tactics, as seen in that episode. Even when he was temporarily brought to the dark side, quite similar to how Darth Sidious tempted him eventually, the only thing on his mind is to save people, to bring peace to the galaxy.

It's...really sad. He was an emotional person, someone who isn't willing to give up if it means he could do as much good as possible. Seeing him turning into a villain from a respected hero is really tragic. I don't think I've ever seen a character like him. He never wanted to be the chosen one, he just wants to live up to the expectations of Obi-wan, of the Jedi, and be good.

I think it's a shame that the prequels and especially Episode 3 didn't sell this point as well as it could. I feel like him turning into the dark side should be more impactful, more emotional, but that's just me. 

What do you guys think?","Something on my mind that I want to share I just finished watching the clone wars episode, Ghost of Mortis.

Showerthought: what if Anakin dueled Yoda and won before dueling Obi-Wan?,"I remember re-watching RotS and the line ""love can't save you, only my new powers can do that,"" had no real effect on me. Along with the fact that he didn't even land a single hit on Obi-Wan yet schooled Count Dooku really made me doubt if Anakin was the chosen one. 



But imagine if he wasn't sent to Mustafar that early and then Yoda attacks Palps. The first part of their duel along with the dialogue could play the same, then Anakin walks in like he did with Windu but this time, has a fair fight with Yoda. Yoda schools Anakin for the first half of the match and lands a few strikes. But before he can kill him (also a way to show the arrogance of the Jedi), Anakin taps into the dark side and destroys Yoda in the duel. Sidious gets excited, and Anakin finishes off Yoda with force lightning (which Sidious hadn't taught him). The fight could take place in the Senate theater or whatever, and Yoda escapes in the same fashion he did in the actual film. Then the words ""failed I have, into exile I must go"" have much more effect on the audience, as Yoda was the one Anakin went to first when it came to his visions. Not Obi-Wan, not Palpatine, but Yoda. And because of that, we get some character development from Yoda that ties into Episode 5 and 6, and shows us that Yoda (and the Jedi to an extent) wasn't as powerful as we might have believed. 


The duel with Obi-Wan should play out the same but Anakin should have the upper hand and almost kill Obi-Wan like 5 times for majority of the fight. 


As with Padme, maybe they could get all lovey-dovey for like the first minute. But once she realizes that he did betray the Jedi/Republic, that he killed younglings, and he almost killed Yoda then instead of ""breaking her heart"" she should pull out a blaster or something and shoot Anakin, realizing he's no longer the same guy that fathered your kids. Maybe the first two hits land and he's screaming in pain, then he pulls off a Kylo and freezes the third one in midair or something than force chokes Padme. This would have been the perfect climax to a tragic love story, where they both believed they betrayed the other, and then Obi-Wan comes, they fight, and the rest is history. This would have made the creation of Darth Vader much more epic, as you see a greater rise in power than we'll ever see in the SW world, and much more tragic too, as he realizes the one person he tried to save, truly loved, and did everything for, whether it be killing younglings or betraying the Jedi, betrayed him.

Getting a feel for what you guys think,"So I've recently started playing the New Jedi Order mod for Empire at War. It's awesome. If for no other reason than ALL the Star Wars ships being in the game. 

But it's also super fun. Playing as the New Republic at the height of the Vong invasion. There's like 155 planets in the Galaxy. Besides the Vong, theres the Imperial Remnant, the Empire of the Hand, Corporate Sector Authority, the Srr-ruuvi Imperium, New Republic, and neutral factions like the Hapes Consortium

Playing last night for the first time, well it's crazy fun. The scramble of playing as the New Republic trying to hold worlds against the Vong while all these other factions take advantage of the situation was super fun. 

So I'm going to do a Let's Play kind of thing a bit like what I did with this, the Elder Scrolls mod for medieval 2. 

What do you guys think? If you like the idea? What faction would you like to see the most? Again choices are 

Vong

Imperial Remnant 

Empire of the Hand

Corporate Sector Authority

Srri-ruuvi Imperium

New Republic/Galactic Alliance (depends on scenario) 

Scenarios: 

4 ABY Truce at Bakura 

19 ABY Hand of Thrawn

22ABY-25ABY The Vong War

This one is subdivided into the initial invasion, the forming of the GA, and the retaking of Coruscant.

All Out War: 

Each faction starts established with the Vong Invasion in full swing 

One Planet Start: 

What it says. You start with a single world, so does everyone else. Neutral worlds are held by neutral factions like the Hapes Consortium 

So what do you guys think? Link to my last other version from before. This one will be much easier to finish.

Rey and Kylo ren should switch sides,"If someone has said something like this all ready there fucking right. I think fighting the empire, losing friends and getting put on pedistle should turn Rey to the dark side. While runing the empire and (trying to bleed the rebelons support) do some good turn kylo ren to the light side. Kylo ren's turn would start with a unimportant decision that ends up saving a lot of live but would cost the empire the same ether way. He would smirk so himself and say wouldn't master Skywalker be proud. Rey could have some jealous moments from watching Finn and Rose have a normal relationship(something she can't have as a jedi).","Rey and Kylo ren should switch sides If someone has said something like this all ready there fucking right.

An examination of Luke's character arc as viewed through the Hero's Journey,"Disclaimer: This is just my interpretation, I'm not claiming to be some storytelling expert or anything.

It's pretty well-known that George structured Luke's story around the ""Hero's Journey""/""monomyth"", a classic structure in mythology popularized by Joseph Campbell where the hero goes from a nobody to a somebody.

I've seen some discussions saying that Luke had a complete character arc by the end of RotJ and that everything since (mostly TLJ, then) is stupid and unnecessary since his journey was complete. I actually feel the opposite and I'll try to explain why.

If you actually look up the different parts of the journey as defined by Joseph Campbell they roughly (sometimes better than others) correlate with Luke's journey. I'll be quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey#Campbell's_seventeen_stages) for some of these. They are, in order:

Part 1:

- The call to adventure - Luke seeing R2's Leia message and his journey to Obi-Wan
- Refusal of the call - Luke declines Obi-Wan's offer to learn the Jedi ways and goes back to his home (we all know what happens next)
- Supernatural aid - Obi-Wan teaches Luke how to listen to the Force
- Crossing the threshold - You might say this is when Luke sees Vader kill Obi-Wan, a point of no return
- Belly of the whale - Luke flies right into Vader and the Death Star and uses his newfound powers to claim victory

Part 2:  

- The road of trials - Luke training with Yoda
- The meeting with the goddess - This one doesn't really apply. The definition is ""This is where the hero gains items given to him that will help him in the future"" so in a sense you could say it's the cave where Luke sees himself in Vader's helmet (he was 'given' this warning). It could also more literally be when Obi-Wan gave Luke the lightsaber, so this step just happens to occur in Star Wars earlier than it normally would.
- Woman as temptress - Not a woman, but his friends. Luke's tempted to abandon his training and save his friends on Bespin.
- Atonement with the father - Both Luke's confrontation with Vader in ESB and then later in RotJ
- Apotheosis - Defined as ""This is the point of realization in which a greater understanding is achieved,"" this is when Luke sees Vader's hand, sees his own hand is the same, throws down his lightsaber in front of the Emperor, and refuses to take his father's place.
- The ultimate boon - Defined as ""The ultimate boon is the achievement of the goal of the quest."" Because of Luke the Emperor, Vader, and the Empire are destroyed.

A full, complete character arc, right?

Not so fast. There's an entire third act to the Hero's Journey that Luke Skywalker's character has been following since 1977.

Part 3:  

- Refusal of the return - Luke exiles himself on Ahch-To
- The magic flight - (Doesn't really apply)
- Rescue from without - Defined as ""Just as the hero may need guides and assistants to set out on the quest, often he must have powerful guides and rescuers to bring them back to everyday life, especially if the person has been wounded or weakened by the experience."" This is literally the plot of TLJ.
- The crossing of the return threshold - Defined as ""The trick in returning is to retain the wisdom gained on the quest, to integrate that wisdom into a human life, and then maybe figure out how to share the wisdom with the rest of the world."" I think this is Yoda helping Luke integrate his failures into a positive message, and then Luke realizing how he can restore the Legend of Luke Skywalker.
- Master of two worlds - Defined as ""For a human hero, it may mean achieving a balance between the material and spiritual."" This is actually pretty literal in TLJ, where we see Luke project himself across the galaxy. He has a material form and a 'spirit' form, which we've never seen someone do before (only one or the other, alive or Force Ghost, never both at the same time).
- Freedom to live - Defined as ""Mastery leads to freedom from the fear of death, which in turn is the freedom to live."" At the end of TLJ Luke looks up, peaceful and hopeful, and fades away.

So in my opinion, by the end of RotJ Luke has only completed 2/3 of the Hero's Journey that his character was written to follow. Luke's story in TFA and TLJ actually complete the entire journey as classically defined.","An examination of Luke's character arc as viewed through the Hero's Journey Disclaimer: This is just my interpretation, I'm not claiming to be some storytelling expert or anything.

How do you want Kylo‚Äôs character to come to an end?,"Personally, I want to see Kylo die. It‚Äôs just a fitting conclusion. He‚Äôs always been a dick. He‚Äôs killed his father, attempted to kill his uncle/old master, and killed his new master all in the name of the dark side.

He‚Äôs a power hungry monster. Completely immersed in the dark side.

I want him to go out with a bang, like in an explosion or something. Nobody wants a long drawn out scene where Kylo is dying from a wound and says his final goodbyes/curses. This character is not someone we should like at all. I want to see fear and regret on every last inch of his face before he‚Äôs gone. 

I really want to see him get his ass kicked by Finn and Rey, and ultimately I want a cool scene where Rey is holding him down, blades crossed, as the entire place explodes.

In any good movie, both parties die. One for the sake of good, one in the face of fear.

What is With The Obsession With the Knights of Ren?,"One thing I keep seeing so often is people complaining about the lack of the Knights of Ren, especially about episode 8.

Outside of that Snoke says Kylo Ren is the master of the Knights of Ren and then the ‚Äúdozen students‚Äù Ben took with him when he fell which can be assumed became the Knights of Ren. 

I‚Äôve seen people complain they weren‚Äôt in episode 8 and just forgotten. Actually Rian wanted to use them for the throne room but felt they could be better used later on than be killed off by Ben and Rey.

But regardless, I just don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs up with the obsessions people have with them. Like I get that the look cool and we could speculate some cool stories they could be involved with. But then again, we have no information on them and they haven‚Äôt been really needed yet. So what‚Äôs the big deal about them? ","What is With The Obsession With the Knights of Ren?

Should Reylo/Rin Happen? Or neither?,"Earlier I was having a discussion with some friends about whether Reylo (Rey and Kylo) or Rinn (Rey and Finn) should happen. One chose Reylo. The other, Rinn. And me, I chose neither. Here‚Äôs my reasoning:

Rey. Doesn‚Äôt. Need. A. Relationship. She‚Äôs already such a strong woman and independent character. I feel that giving her a relationship is unneeded right now. In the future, sure maybe. But I don‚Äôt know about right now. I think that the plot needs to focus on her gaining more control of her abilities and herself.  Giving her a relationship would just complicate things further. Especially if it was with Kylo or Finn. 

If it was with Kylo, how on earth would that work? He‚Äôs on a whole different side than her, and has a goal to eradicate the Jedi and Sith. That‚Äôs NOT what Rey wants.

Could Yoda's real name be Dayo?,,Could Yoda's real name be Dayo? 
Snoke Matters,"Let's be clear, Snoke is a boring, stupid, lazy idea. From top to bottom, he is a generic rip-off of a thing and his unnecessarily CGI body is one of the few glaring flaws in the special effects of these movies. He is Abrams' lack of originality and Johnson's belligerent incompetence made manifest and I hate him passionately.

That said, he matters.

Perhaps the single biggest flaw of the sequels is their almost nonexistent setting and confusing premise. The very idea of the sequel trilogy begs questions and demands answers, *just to understand the concept and get a sense of the stakes.* It does this by creating a convoluted scenario that is only possible through extraordinary circumstances and places its main villain as the singular origin of said scenario. Every major character, situation, and conflict in this trilogy exists because of him, yet we don't know what he is, why he is, how he is, or where he was. I cannot stress enough that just because no one ever wondered out loud ""who the fuck is this guy, how did he accomplish so much with so little, and what's with his arbitrary fixation on the empire and Vader?"" doesn't mean the film isn't asking that question to get the audience interested. It certainly doesn't mean the a story that is dependent upon those answers doesn't need to actually answer them.

As it stands Snoke exists only as a contrived plot device to justify a contrived setting. Yet, bafflingly, instead of actually utilizing this convenient plot device *they themselves created*, they've simply elected not to set the stage for the conflict. Now, not only is Snoke a stupid idea, but he is a constant reminder of one of the biggest flaws of this series and how easily it could be fixed.

This is the crux of the problem here: Snoke sucks, but the movies suck (worse) as long as he remains unexplained. Now the most common defenses of Snoke's portrays are misguided at best, but I get where they're coming from so I'll try to be diplomatic:

1. He's boring: Yes he is, but that doesn't mean he needs to be. The ideal story would have made him not boring in the first place or at least fixed him in the sequel *before* it killed him off.
2. His death is such a cool moment and is necessary for kylo's development: I agree to an extent, but I think it doesn't actually stick the landing on-screen. However, I cannot and do not want to take away anyone's enjoyment. I can only ask how much better that moment would have been if we spent some time setting him up as an actual threat, explaining what he's trying do do and why it matters, setting the stage so we know what's at stake and want him to lose, and establishing Kylo as a distinctly different direction for the first order. The moment of his death and Kylo's coup would have completely changed the trajectory of the series and the only difference is a bit more information. As it stands his death feels unceremonious and pointless. There goes that guy who we needed to know more about, aw shucks. The only real change is to Kylo and he only reverts back to his character in TFA, but with more administrative control.
3. If you had your way, the movies would be just a big lore-dump: this is a profoundly bad-faith interpretation of Snoke criticisms. It's obvious that isn't what *anyone* wants and it's sad to see people use such a close-minded argument. All it would take is a few scenes, maybe even just some dialogue and these movie would feel dramatically more coherent and less contrived. That's all anyone is asking for. It wouldn't even need to be very in-depth--Snoke would ideally be as mysterious and vague as possible--it only needs to make sense.
4. You're just a mad man-baby because your fanboy-theories didn't matter: this is such a common and pointlessly cruel and mean-spirited thing to say that it's difficult to even address the argument it's presenting. Not only does Snoke matter, but--and I cannot stress this enough--""Snoke theories"" *only* exist as an attempt to makes sense of the movies. They are a direct reaction to the actual text of the story, *and they are exclusively an expression of* ***the desire to like this trilogy.*** To react so angrily to this desire almost implies that good movies aren't meant to be enjoyed so much as clinically analyzed from a distance and rewarded based not on execution but on attempt.
5. ""X detail"" explains it in the EU/Snoke's backstory is irrelevant to the main plot and should only be covered in the EU: For the first statement, It's my understanding of the current EU that this is simply not the case, or at least nothing that fixes every problem exists. For the second, it's just not, Snoke is such a key piece of information in the Sequels that not understanding *anything* about him makes the story feel directionless. The core flaw of both of these arguments is the same: the EU is being used as a crutch for bad storytelling. The EU is not for finishing the plots of the movies (nor should it be for fleshing out irrelevant details, but one problem at a time), it's for telling stories *inspired* by the movies. The movies themselves should be self contained, and if I need the EU for the movie to work, the movie is bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Look, there's more I could say but here's the heart of my problem. I just want to enjoy these movies. That's all. But sometimes it feels like they and their fans are actively fighting to keep me from doing so. Just because you might not be bothered by Snoke doesn't mean he isn't a problem that needs to be fixed, nor does it mean that I wan't these movies to be something they're not. In the end, Snoke *should* be dead, I *should* be *glad* that he's dead, but I still feel nothing about it. Much of my feelings surrounding the sequels can be summed up in statements along the lines of ""The story would be in a much better, more interesting place if ""X"" was actually treated like it mattered as much as it actually does.""

Edit: Spelling.","Snoke Matters Let's be clear, Snoke is a boring, stupid, lazy idea. From top to bottom, he is a generic rip-off of a thing and his unnecessarily CGI body is one of the few glaring flaws in the special effects of these movies. He is Abrams' lack of originality and Johnson's belligerent incompetence made manifest and I hate him passionately.

That said, he matters.

Perhaps the single biggest flaw of the sequels is their almost nonexistent setting and confusing premise. The very idea of the sequel trilogy begs questions and demands answers, *just to understand the concept and get a sense of the stakes.* It does this by creating a convoluted scenario that is only possible through extraordinary circumstances and places its main villain as the singular origin of said scenario. Every major character, situation, and conflict in this trilogy exists because of him, yet we don't know what he is, why he is, how he is, or where he was. I cannot stress enough that just because no one ever wondered out loud ""who the fuck is this guy, how did he accomplish so much with so little, and what's with his arbitrary fixation on the empire and Vader?"" doesn't mean the film isn't asking that question to get the audience interested. It certainly doesn't mean the a story that is dependent upon those answers doesn't need to actually answer them.

As it stands Snoke exists only as a contrived plot device to justify a contrived setting. Yet, bafflingly, instead of actually utilizing this convenient plot device *they themselves created*, they've simply elected not to set the stage for the conflict. Now, not only is Snoke a stupid idea, but he is a constant reminder of one of the biggest flaws of this series and how easily it could be fixed.

This is the crux of the problem here: Snoke sucks, but the movies suck (worse) as long as he remains unexplained. Now the most common defenses of Snoke's portrays are misguided at best, but I get where they're coming from so I'll try to be diplomatic:

1. He's boring: Yes he is, but that doesn't mean he needs to be. The ideal story would have made him not boring in the first place or at least fixed him in the sequel *before* it killed him off.
2. His death is such a cool moment and is necessary for kylo's development: I agree to an extent, but I think it doesn't actually stick the landing on-screen. However, I cannot and do not want to take away anyone's enjoyment. I can only ask how much better that moment would have been if we spent some time setting him up as an actual threat, explaining what he's trying do do and why it matters, setting the stage so we know what's at stake and want him to lose, and establishing Kylo as a distinctly different direction for the first order. The moment of his death and Kylo's coup would have completely changed the trajectory of the series and the only difference is a bit more information. As it stands his death feels unceremonious and pointless. There goes that guy who we needed to know more about, aw shucks. The only real change is to Kylo and he only reverts back to his character in TFA, but with more administrative control.
3. If you had your way, the movies would be just a big lore-dump: this is a profoundly bad-faith interpretation of Snoke criticisms. It's obvious that isn't what *anyone* wants and it's sad to see people use such a close-minded argument. All it would take is a few scenes, maybe even just some dialogue and these movie would feel dramatically more coherent and less contrived. That's all anyone is asking for. It wouldn't even need to be very in-depth--Snoke would ideally be as mysterious and vague as possible--it only needs to make sense.
4. You're just a mad man-baby because your fanboy-theories didn't matter: this is such a common and pointlessly cruel and mean-spirited thing to say that it's difficult to even address the argument it's presenting. Not only does Snoke matter, but--and I cannot stress this enough--""Snoke theories"" *only* exist as an attempt to makes sense of the movies. They are a direct reaction to the actual text of the story, *and they are exclusively an expression of* ***the desire to like this trilogy.*** To react so angrily to this desire almost implies that good movies aren't meant to be enjoyed so much as clinically analyzed from a distance and rewarded based not on execution but on attempt.
5. ""X detail"" explains it in the EU/Snoke's backstory is irrelevant to the main plot and should only be covered in the EU: For the first statement, It's my understanding of the current EU that this is simply not the case, or at least nothing that fixes every problem exists. For the second, it's just not, Snoke is such a key piece of information in the Sequels that not understanding *anything* about him makes the story feel directionless. The core flaw of both of these arguments is the same: the EU is being used as a crutch for bad storytelling. The EU is not for finishing the plots of the movies (nor should it be for fleshing out irrelevant details, but one problem at a time), it's for telling stories *inspired* by the movies. The movies themselves should be self contained, and if I need the EU for the movie to work, the movie is bad.

I think it is imperative we get a live action Clone War era film as soon as possible,"I've been playing a lot of the Capital Supremacy mode from the new Battlefront 2 and my god is it amazing. A lot of craft went into it, and all the Prequel era content is just a nice love letter to the films and the 2008 series. 

Unfortunately, we have never gotten to see the Clone Wars in live action, just the inciting incident and the end of the war. In fact, we never even got to see live action Clone Trooper armor. I think a Clone Wars film, with the grit of Rogue One and the writing of the 2008 series could be incredible. While I am eagerly anticipating the new season of the show, I think the era itself deserves a proper live action depiction of an important battle, event or story. 

I also think the cast of the prequels definitely have aged well enough to pull off those same characters. Captain Marvel showed us that someone like Samuel L Jackson can be digitally de-aged (even though I don't think it would be necessary in this rhetorical film). 

With a strong script, I think Hayden and Ewan can definitely knock their duo dynamic out of the park, similar to the opening segments of Revenge of the Sith.","I think it is imperative we get a live action Clone War era film as soon as possible I've been playing a lot of the Capital Supremacy mode from the new Battlefront 2 and my god is it amazing.

"Are you excited, or lackadaisical about Episode IX?","I don't want this to be a post about bashing the new trilogy, I'm just curious about how enthused the community is about the upcoming movie.

Personally, I'm just not excited. I enjoyed The Force Awakens, but really felt disappointed with The Last Jedi. It felt like the first two could have been combined and some of the filler from both eliminated to make a really engaging start to the new trilogy.  

At the end of TLJ, I just felt like the story was over and I don't really care what happens next. 

Personally, I would have loved to see Ben Solo and Rey both get some serious mentoring and training to build them up as more powerful, skilled, and trained force users.  TFA straight up stated that Ben needed to complete his training, and Rey was literally standing in front of a Jedi Master looking to be trained.  

Dunno, just felt like they focused more on cool visuals and fast tracking the plot than developing the characters and giving them arcs of growth that we as the audience could enjoy.

I like the new characters, but don't like their arcs and its left me feeling pretty unenthusiastic about what's next. 

What's your take? Tell me what you enjoy and give me a reason to get excited again!

Kylo Ren hesitates, even as his wingman opens fire on the command deck. Leia is blown brutally out of the capital ship, debris from the deck--navicomputers, schematics screens, chairs, operations officers--slamming into her left and right. A console collides with her and snaps her right forearm clean in half. She floats, suspended in the vacuum of space, her normally neat hair tangled and fanned out around her face like a halo. Her clothes are streaked with blood. Leia opens her eyes as the ravaged bodies of her fellow commanders, including Ackbar, float past her. She gasps for air and throws her remaining arm out, trying desperately to drag herself back onto the Raddus using the Force. A TIE fighter streaks past her, breaking her precarious hold on the ship and sending her into a nauseating spin. As laserfire blazes around her, she kicks her legs and reaches out again, trying to gain purchase. When she finally makes it onto the ship and closes the airlock, she collapses in a gasping, writhing heap.

It's the middle of the night in Chez Jedi School when Ben Solo wakes up to find Professor Luke standing over his bed, a menacing lightsaber held over his head. He thinks it's a training exercise and laughs, nonchalantly rolling out of bed. Then he notices the look on Luke's face and throws up his arms in surrender. Luke backs him against the wall. Ben is bewildered, breathing hard in a panic, while Luke looks utterly conflicted. ""I'm sorry, kid.""

Ben whispers ""why?"" and pleads for his life from ""uncle Luke"", his voice breaking, tearful, young, and vulnerable. The scene cuts off, cuing Rey's immediate sympathy and righteous fury on Kylo Ren's behalf.

Later on, when the flashback is repeated and extended, we see that Ben's tears are a ploy. Even as he plays on Luke's sympathies, he is using the Force to guide his lightsaber towards Luke's back (a parallel to how he will kill Snoke later in in the film.) Just as he ignites it, Luke spins around and knocks it out of the way. Ben's lightsaber flies into his right hand and with his left, he pulls the cabin roof above Luke's head.  Steel snaps and wood splinters, crashing down around Luke and pinning the Jedi Master to the floor.

""You need a Master Codebreaker,"" Maz Kanata tells them. ""What's the closest planet?""

Poe cranes his head towards the navicomputer.

""Cantonica,"" Rose readily supplies.  She's terse.  She knows that against General Organa's orders, Poe sent her sister to her death.

""Go to the Casino,"" Maz casts the image of a red flower onto her transmission. ""This is the insignia for the Codebreaker's Guild; the members frequent the sabaac tables.""

They're at the Casino, Rose sporting an Imperial uniform provisioned by Poe and Finn wearing the dress pants and shirt--but with his Bromance jacket. He doesn't want to wear Imperial colors. Just as in the movie, Rose voices her contempt towards the denizens of Canto Bight. ""We should help them,"" she says to Finn, scanning the Fathier stables. ""We could free them, with BB-8 and my--""

""We need to focus on the mission,"" Finn tells her. He's thinking about his stolen childhood as he says, almost too flippantly, ""Lots of kids don't get to grow up the way they want."" This is his stormtrooper training--feelings compartmentalized, a single minded focus on saving the *Raddus* so he can find Rey and be done with all of this.

""My sister would--""

""Your sister's dead."" It does shut her up, but then it's too late to take his words back. ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--""

""You're a coward,"" Rose says, backing away from him. ""My sister sacrificed herself to save us and you, you--""

Two police officers tackle Finn, dragging him away from Rose and BB-8. ""FN-2187, you are under arrest..."" There's a bounty on his head from the First Order...

...Finn meets DJ in the jail cell and notices the red flower pin on his hat.  ""You're a codebreaker?"" he asks DJ, who does his characteristic hemhaw uh sure right.  The two strike a deal. Before long, DJ has broken out and Finn and Rose are racing through the city in a (significantly truncated and less tedious) Fathier chase. The other Fathiers run free, but Catonica security forces corner Rose and Finn on the beach.

When it appears all is lost, DJ and BB-8 show up with the ship.  Finn and Rose leave the remaining Fathier to run off with it's brethren.

As their ship pulls into the atmosphere, Catonica security forces blast the Fathier that saved Rose and Finn's life. Helplessly, Rose watches as it collapses lifeless on the beach, sending up a tuft of scorched sand.  (I don't like sand.) This time, she doesn't cry. She's all resolve. If they don't succeed in their mission then it's a pointless sacrifice.  There have been too many already.

As their shuttle drifts away from a disintegrating *Supremacy*, drifting among the debris of the *Raddus,* Finn and Rose wonder if everyone is dead.  They don't have the context the other Resistance members have about Holdo--they'll learn that off screen when they turn up on Crait.

Later, when she sees Finn's ski speeder careening towards the siege gun, barreling towards certain death...

How can Ep. IX build up hype and anticipation for the fan base and general audiences?,"We‚Äôre getting close to the point where the title and first trailer will soon be dropped. The question now becomes whether Lucasfilm/Disney can start building up hype and anticipation for both fans and general audiences for what is ostensibly the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga.

The positive signs are that it will have been 18 months between the last Star Wars release, giving audiences a chance to breathe a little, and that it will be back to a Christmas release where it won‚Äôt face as much competition as Solo did. So there is plenty of time to start getting fans and general audiences interested in SW again, especially with how the film has been stated to close the Skywalker Saga while tying all of the trilogies together.

Signs for concern are that the fandom is still bitterly divided over the ST, and the combination of TLJ‚Äôs polarizing reception and Solo‚Äôs underperformance has led to speculation that the SW brand is no longer connecting with general audiences as it once did, especially in contrast to Marvel which has seemingly taken SW‚Äôs place as the dominant entertainment juggernaut (Note, I am not starting an SW/Marvel flame war so please don‚Äôt). 

With that said, how will the marketing and buildup to IX‚Äôs release be able to drum up anticipation for it in light of the fandom‚Äôs endless wars over the ST and Disney‚Äôs stewardship of the franchise?","How can Ep.

Snoke has been an unanswered question for a reason.,"Let's look at the history of Star Wars: In 1977, A New Hope was released. In 1980, Empire Strikes Back was released. In 1983, Return of the Jedi was released. 

At the time those films were released, no one knew who Darth Sidious or Darth Vader were, or how they came to be, or what reasons they had for doing the things they did. We were given some context to Vader throughout, but Sidious was just as big of a mystery as Snoke currently is.

Sidious and Vader were just installed into viewer's brains as the leaders of the Empire, and that was fine. In the end, they were just plot devices, meant to fuel the advancement of the story, and give Luke a push towards, and temptation against being a Jedi. Their full backstory wasn't given to us for almost two decades afterwards, and until Phantom Menace was released, I doubt many people really cared about the origins of the two top bad guys of the universe.

But, Snoke and Kylo just showed up out of nowhere, leading the First Order in TFA. Although Kylo has been pretty well explained (in some parallel to us learning parts of Vader's story), Snoke still remains a mystery (a parallel to Sidious). 

If any of you have heard of, or even watched, the original and prequel trilogies in ""Machete Order"", you will recognize that there is a lot of parallelism in the Star Wars movies. And, although I've seen it put as ""A deliberate ripoff"" of ANH, I think TFA continues that parallelism, with it and TLJ showing the same kind of tie ins to the original trilogy, as the prequel trilogy had to the originals.

Now, we've seen Disney reaching out and putting stories together outside of the big, Roman Numeral movies with Solo and Rogue One. We're also *supposedly* getting a Boba Fett movie, depending on which rumors you've read in the last month or two. Depending on how far Disney pushes the expanding universe of Star Wars, we could be seeing all kinds of backstories and sidestories that tie into the Numerals.

Presuming that Ep. IX doesn't have Snoke's story in it, we can also presume that Snoke's story may be planned as one of these expanded universe movies. 

And that is where I want to make my point: Snoke hasn't been explained yet, because **he doesn't need to be explained yet.**

The focus of Ep. VII-IX does not need to be the Grand Arc of Snoke, just as Ep. IV-VI did not need to be the Grand Arc of Sidious. Right now, we need the Grand Arc of Rey &amp; Friends, just as we got the Grand Arc of Luke &amp; Friends to kick off the franchise.

Disney knows that Snoke is a sticking point in this trilogy. They can't *not* know it, with how wildly angry it has made the fans. But, Snoke is/was a plot device to kick off this trilogy, where we are saying goodbye to old hands, and breaking in the newbies (both the actors and fans), and we simply don't need to know everything about him right now. Snoke and Kylo were meant to be installed in our brains as big bad guys, just like Sidious and Vader were, 40 years ago.

However, I suspect there are already plans for additional movies about Snoke's history after Ep. IX is released. There are some 30 years gap between ROTJ and TLJ, and that's plenty of blank slate to fill in. 

I don't like how Snoke has been handled any more than most of you, but have a little faith that we will get our answers, even if they come later than we want.","Snoke has been an unanswered question for a reason.

"[Movie] ""Final"" Jedi High Council","Can someone clarify who the ""final"" members of the Jedi Council were at the end of the Revenge of the Sith (immediately before things went pear shaped for them).

From my understanding there's 12 members of the council (one of whom is the Grand Master). From scenes in the movie it seems like this is the list.

* Yoda
* Mace Windu
* Obi-Wan Kenobi
* Plo Koon
* Ki-Adi-Mundi
* Kit Fisto
* Saesee Tiin
* Shaak Ti
* Stass Allie
* Agen Kolar
* Coleman Kcaj
* Anakin Skywalker

But there's 2 other Jedi Masters who as far as I can tell would still have been part of the council. Oppo Rancisis (I can't find anything indicating he was removed, left, or died or anything between the end of the Clone Wars series and the Order 66). Additionally, Depa Billaba seems like she's still on. Idk all her story but it seems like she was brought back onto the council and was part of it until the end.

I could see them temporarily having 13 or kicking one of those two off for Anakin but I'm trying to figure out what happened (with regards to the council) to them or if the above list is wrong.

(Hopefully I'm flairing this right, I couldn't find a list of options)

How much do you guys wanna bet that Chewy is gonna die in the next movie? Here‚Äôs how I think it will happen.,"I think he will, because it would be unexpected, like when...


(SPOILERS) 



Han died. No one expected Han to get killed in the first movie. 

Here‚Äôs how I think it will go down.

Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewy and whoever else will get trapped, stuck in a bad spot, or something along those lines where it seems like they‚Äôll meet their end by the first order half way through the movie. They start talking about a way out and the only way they see is if one of them distracts the stormtroopers long to make the escape.

Finn volunteers first, but someone (either Rey or Poe) will tell him no, and that they will. They start debating about who will sacrifice themselves, eventually Chewy will volunteer to sacrifice himself, everyone shuts up, and looks at Chewy, and Rey will comment ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù But Chewy will tell them that he‚Äôs fine with doing, and everyone agrees that Chewy will be the one to sacrifice himself with no contest, and everyone leaves while Chewy charges in, blasting away. He‚Äôll probably die to blaster shots, or an explosion of some kind.

That‚Äôs how I think Chewy will die.","How much do you guys wanna bet that Chewy is gonna die in the next movie? Here‚Äôs how I think it will happen. I think he will, because it would be unexpected, like when...

Question to Those Who Saw Ep II In Theatres,"Just watched Star Wars Episode II, and the scene near the end where Count Dooku and Darth Sideous talk in that hideout about the war starting in Coruscant provoked a question I have to all those old enough to have watched the prequel trilogy in theatres. Was this the scene where everyone found out that Palpatine was the Sith Lord, or did this scene not make it 100% clear enough to draw that conclusion? In this scene not all of Sideous' face is visible but his voice is no different than that of Chancellor Palpatine. Was this the ""giveaway scene"" or did people not realize the identity of of Sideous until Ep III? Or maybe was it even earlier in Ep II or even Ep I that you realized this? Just curious because I am not lucky to have been young enough to have seen the prequels in theatres.","Question to Those Who Saw Ep II In Theatres Just watched Star Wars Episode II, and the scene near the end where Count Dooku and Darth Sideous talk in that hideout about the war starting in Coruscant provoked a question I have to all those old enough to have watched the prequel trilogy in theatres.

"DJ's ""Selling to both sides"" comment starts to make sense if we look at the shell companies that spun off to create FO weapons.","I have a number of problems with DJ but their is one that I think can be worked around.  And that is his revelation that these weapons manufactures were selling to both sides (Which lowkey means Leia way buying from slavers I guess) and making a ton of money off of it. But with what had been revealed about the FO that didn't really make much sense to me. So I wanted to take a deeper look and see if we can twist that scene into something that does make some sense.

So before the end of the Galactic Civil War Papa Palps set up a bunch of factories and ship yards in the unknown regions.

We learn that by 6 years before TFA they have infiltrated agents and sympathetic people into the government and started to reach out to their contacts.

And some time in the six years between Bloodline and TFA they reveal theirself to the galaxy and become a proper state/political party (with some of the sympathetic planets seceding or at least identifying as FO in their politics. IDK the Propaganda book makes this part blurry). During this time their is also apparently a treaty that is formed that bars the sell of weapons to the First Order. To get around this treaty many companies spin off smaller shell companies.

&gt;To avoid treaty restrictions banning the sale of weaponry to the First Order, galactic arms manufacturers BlasTech Industries and Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. spun off a subsidiary known as the Sonn-Blas Corporation, which manufactured much of the First Order's weaponry within First Order space. Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems also helped produce vessels such as the FO/Tie. Sienar-Jaemus Army Systems manufactured the widely used AAL, which could ferry twenty stormtroopers into combat, while the Aratech-Loratus Corporation developed the LIUV; on ground the First Order also used a wide range of four-legged walkers similar to Imperial AT-ATs. In violation of New Republic laws regarding capital ships, Kuat-Entralla Engineering developed the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer

Now all of these shell companies are apparently (at least according to the sparse data in the visual dictionaries) working in FO space in FO owned systems on FO owned factories/shipyards.

So its kind of like while they are being made in FO space they are being made by companies that are renting FO machines or using FO machinery to build their blueprints.

And we can say they are selling to both sides since their parent companies are making speeders (aratech), blasters (mer sonn), binoculars (neuro-saav), and the U-55 Orbital Loadlifter (which is obviously a gallofree yards design that was bought and is being produced by Sienar Fleet Systems).

Though while Incom was put under imperial rule in the GCW due to the use of its X-wings in the war their is nothing showing Incom-FreiTek selling to the FO, nor are they partnered with Sienar who is their main rival. So I'm not sure about the holograms unless its just to show the subsystems on the fighters. Taim &amp; Bak the company that produces the laser cannons on the T-75's also produced a number of laser canons for the Empire so maybe they were still selling to the FO as well though a shell company.

So I guess we can say he was right. I mean shell companies are just a polite legal fiction so it is really the same as the parent company doing it. And if we squint hard enough at some things we can make a connection. Though other than a possible maybe on the blasters and the bionoculars I can't find any more resistance gear that is made by the same companies that make the FO gear.
","DJ's ""Selling to both sides"" comment starts to make sense if we look at the shell companies that spun off to create FO weapons. I have a number of problems with DJ but their is one that I think can be worked around.  And that is his revelation that these weapons manufactures were selling to both sides (Which lowkey means Leia way buying from slavers I guess) and making a ton of money off of it. But with what had been revealed about the FO that didn't really make much sense to me. So I wanted to take a deeper look and see if we can twist that scene into something that does make some sense.

So before the end of the Galactic Civil War Papa Palps set up a bunch of factories and ship yards in the unknown regions.

We learn that by 6 years before TFA they have infiltrated agents and sympathetic people into the government and started to reach out to their contacts.

And some time in the six years between Bloodline and TFA they reveal theirself to the galaxy and become a proper state/political party (with some of the sympathetic planets seceding or at least identifying as FO in their politics. IDK the Propaganda book makes this part blurry). During this time their is also apparently a treaty that is formed that bars the sell of weapons to the First Order. To get around this treaty many companies spin off smaller shell companies.

&gt;To avoid treaty restrictions banning the sale of weaponry to the First Order, galactic arms manufacturers BlasTech Industries and Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc. spun off a subsidiary known as the Sonn-Blas Corporation, which manufactured much of the First Order's weaponry within First Order space. Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems also helped produce vessels such as the FO/Tie. Sienar-Jaemus Army Systems manufactured the widely used AAL, which could ferry twenty stormtroopers into combat, while the Aratech-Loratus Corporation developed the LIUV; on ground the First Order also used a wide range of four-legged walkers similar to Imperial AT-ATs. In violation of New Republic laws regarding capital ships, Kuat-Entralla Engineering developed the Resurgent-class Star Destroyer

Now all of these shell companies are apparently (at least according to the sparse data in the visual dictionaries) working in FO space in FO owned systems on FO owned factories/shipyards.

So its kind of like while they are being made in FO space they are being made by companies that are renting FO machines or using FO machinery to build their blueprints.

And we can say they are selling to both sides since their parent companies are making speeders (aratech), blasters (mer sonn), binoculars (neuro-saav), and the U-55 Orbital Loadlifter (which is obviously a gallofree yards design that was bought and is being produced by Sienar Fleet Systems).

Though while Incom was put under imperial rule in the GCW due to the use of its X-wings in the war their is nothing showing Incom-FreiTek selling to the FO, nor are they partnered with Sienar who is their main rival. So I'm not sure about the holograms unless its just to show the subsystems on the fighters. Taim &amp; Bak the company that produces the laser cannons on the T-75's also produced a number of laser canons for the Empire so maybe they were still selling to the FO as well though a shell company.

So I guess we can say he was right. I mean shell companies are just a polite legal fiction so it is really the same as the parent company doing it. And if we squint hard enough at some things we can make a connection. Though other than a possible maybe on the blasters and the bionoculars I can't find any more resistance gear that is made by the same companies that make the FO gear.

Do you think Anakin truly believed the Jedi were evil?,"Rewatching a film a month or so, with some Clones, Rebels, books and comics thrown in between in the lead up to episode IX. 

Got to Revenge of the Sith and when Anakin sides with Sidious there are a lot of shots of Anakin's face where he very much seems conflicted. Someothing that I'm noticing perhaps more with Clone Wars context and the idea of such a long history with the jedi that the films barely scratch.

His immediate ""What have I done"" and the sense of desperation Hayden imbues in him very much seems like he knows Sidious is lying and that he's in the wrong, that he's shattered his whole existence to this point. I feel like he plays it as though he has no choice but to convince himself that he believes the Jedi were planning a coup, that all this is for Padme, because if not, what kind of monster has he become? He's become nothing more than primal rage, no better than a Tusken. ","Do you think Anakin truly believed the Jedi were evil?

When I was a kid I wanted to make a Star Wars movie,"After I saw ANH again in my childhood, after watching the prequels, I thougjt of this movie. 
This movie would be set between Episode 3 and A New Hope. Obi Wan is living alone in a hut silently hiding his presence and protecting Luke from the shadows. Yoda, meanwhile is hiding in Dagobah and meditating in those caves, in order to understand the dark side and try to combat it. Sometime Obi Wan visits kid Luke and tells him beautiful stories of the Republic era and taking him to strange but beautiful places in Tantooine. Ben and Luke develop a strong connection in this way-sometimes Luke would get tired and sleep in his Jedi cloak and Ben would wrap the cloak around him to give him more comfort. In once such instance, he sees Luke almost  looking like a Jedi. Ben puts his lightsaber around him and comments slowly, ""A wonderful Jedi will you be, Luke"". Sometime while staying alone in the hut, he thinks about Anakin- how he loved him as a brother but he still betrayed him. Sometimes he thinks about all the Jedi and soldiers who died in Order 66  He almost gets emotional, but calmes himself as he is a Jedi. In this way he becomes even powerful with the force.  Meanwhile, Palpitine and Vader are mecilessly killing all Jedi. But Vader is still unsatisfied- he wants Obi Wan. He sometimes calls Obi Wan a coward in anger for not fighting with him and blames him for making him into a half-robot, half-human. The obsession with Obi Wan and not finding him only gives him more hatred, which Palpitine enjoys from afar. We  will be shown instances of Vaders torturous existance. Him opening his suit, thinking of Padme, his mother and his dead child. He sounds like a strong man, but inside he is always crying. Now I didn't think about the climax of this movie, but you can think about it. You can add even more dimensions in the story by showing the relationship of Obi Wan and Luke's uncle and aunt. And many more things. I know it will be diffrerent from the other SW movies, but I am sure that it will be a great film","When I was a kid I wanted to make a Star Wars movie After I saw ANH again in my childhood, after watching the prequels, I thougjt of this movie.

Interesting theory about Anakin.,"I recently heard a fan theory that the three main villains from the prequels (Maul, Dooku and Greivous) represent what was to become of Anakin when he became Vader. I'm suprised i never noticed this but Maul represents anger and a lust for revenge, Dooku is a Jedi who had fallen to the dark side and Greivous is a cyborg/part machine. Whether this was intentional by George Lucas or not, we can all agree that these are the traits that make Vader who he is and it's a damn good theory.

Edit- I just want to clarify thit isn't my theory and it is one that i came across from a Youtube comment section. I was just suprised that i had never heard of it before and decided to share it for others who also haven't come across it before.","Interesting theory about Anakin.

I just found out the X-Wings are sold on the open market in the new EU which I guess means no secret Red Squadron mission to capture them,"Its not a well-known story in Legends but it's personally one of my favorites. Possibly because it was in one of the first Star Wars comics I had bought.

but the story of incom scientists defecting to the Rebellion with a secret prototype Starfighter and Red Squadron having to fly in and extract the vehicles was a story I really enjoyed. And I had been hoping to find out what sort of interesting story there was behind the rebels getting them in the new EU.

But I guess that's out the window now since anyone could go out and buy them at least until the Empire started cracking down on incom.

The Rebellion apparently ended up having to construct them in secret shipyards in deep space which is really cool. And I think it could be said that it gives more strength between why lukes t65 and a X-Wing would have the same control scheme if they're both civilian models.

I guess I'm just a little surprised and disappointed that there won't be a new EU version of them rescuing and extracting the scientist and the ships.

Edit: there is also the Empire War version of the story but that game takes a lot of liberties andI'm not really sure how much of it should be counted as Canon when compared to the Books &amp; Comics. probably be treated as Battlefront where the flavor text is Cannon and not much else

Star Wars video game idea,"I‚Äôm not sure if this has been thought of before but I thought I‚Äôd throw an idea out there to see if anyone else thought it was cool.

So, I know a lot of people want games like KOTOR 3 and Jedi Academy 2 but I feel like this game I have in my head NEEDS to be made.

I was playing For Honor the other day and thought of how cool it would be to have a game in that style set in the Star Wars universe. Truly make an experience with in-depth lightsaber combat the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen yet. Different blocking zones, counters, striking, and force ability chances. 

Ideally you would have different jedi classes that allow for certain specialties in the force and lightsaber combat. Be able to customize your character and class in a way that allows you to play in your specific style. Have a ton of awesome Star Wars set pieces for dueling zones, make the game feel lighter with less delay than For Honor, and have a story mode of course.

I believe with a AAA backing and a smooth launch this game could be fantastic. I hope someone has thought of something like this and develops it in the future.","Star Wars video game idea I‚Äôm not sure if this has been thought of before but I thought I‚Äôd throw an idea out there to see if anyone else thought it was cool.

I have a Star Wars addiction.,"Hello my name is boom and I have a Star Wars addiction

I dont know when it started, I think it might have started sometime back in 1999 when I saw TPM as a child then over the years I became more and more obsessed with the sound of pew..pew.pew-pew and wooooom, zoom, keeeeez. It got bad round about 2015 when Disney took over Lucas film and since then things have gone from bad to worse. 

It got really bad last year when I started, to my eternal shame, collecting Star Wars media and even \*Swallows hard\* Lego Star Wars. I am a 30 year old man who plays with toys all because I have a unhealthy addition to space wizards in a galaxy far far away \*tear rolls down cheek, falls onto Yoda T-shirt\*

This past few months have been bad, not a day goes by where I dont consume some Star Wars content, most days I watch my favourite Star Wars YouTubers latest video's and if I do manage to venture outside its only an excuse to listen to a Star Wars podcast. Home life is tough, I spend most days sitting staring at my front door hoping that the post man is coming to deliver my latest Star Wars comic purchase (my drug of choice) only for it to be over all too soon as I read the entire thing instantly. In between all of this I am reading the books and watching the tv shows and movies, sometimes I rewatch them. 

I almost lost my job this year over it because apparently its not ok to try to convince customers to make a purchase by telling them that if can feel their hate and it makes them strong is inappropriate. My boss has also told me that introducing myself to new customers as Darth is costing them business. I was also recently given an official warning for accidentally engraving a customers product with the line ""At one with the force"" and I have been told if my addiction continues to interfere with my work I will be sacked. I work in a funeral home so I guess the is fair enough because it turns out grieving widows find it a bit disturbing when their funeral director turns up and tells them that only through the force can they bring back the ones they love. 

My wife threatened to leave me and take alway the younglings after thinking that I was cheating on her but to my embarrassment I had to explain to her that I was just sneaking off a night to catch the latest episode of Star Wars Resistance.  

This year is going to be even tough for me and my family who will all be forced to watch the Mandalorian then I will force them to head out on a cold December night to watch Star Wars episode 9.

I dont know when it started, I think it might have started sometime back in 1999 when I saw TPM as a child then over the years I became more and more obsessed with the sound of pew..pew.pew-pew and wooooom, zoom, keeeeez. It got bad round about 2015 when Disney took over Lucas film and since then things have gone from bad to worse. 

It got really bad last year when I started, to my eternal shame, collecting Star Wars media and even \*Swallows hard\* Lego Star Wars. I am a 30 year old man who plays with toys all because I have a unhealthy addition to space wizards in a galaxy far far away \*tear rolls down cheek, falls onto Yoda T-shirt\*

This past few months have been bad, not a day goes by where I dont consume some Star Wars content, most days I watch my favourite Star Wars YouTubers latest video's and if I do manage to venture outside its only an excuse to listen to a Star Wars podcast. Home life is tough, I spend most days sitting staring at my front door hoping that the post man is coming to deliver my latest Star Wars comic purchase (my drug of choice) only for it to be over all too soon as I read the entire thing instantly. In between all of this I am reading the books and watching the tv shows and movies, sometimes I rewatch them. 

I almost lost my job this year over it because apparently its not ok to try to convince customers to make a purchase by telling them that if can feel their hate and it makes them strong is inappropriate. My boss has also told me that introducing myself to new customers as Darth is costing them business. I was also recently given an official warning for accidentally engraving a customers product with the line ""At one with the force"" and I have been told if my addiction continues to interfere with my work I will be sacked. I work in a funeral home so I guess the is fair enough because it turns out grieving widows find it a bit disturbing when their funeral director turns up and tells them that only through the force can they bring back the ones they love. 

My wife threatened to leave me and take alway the younglings after thinking that I was cheating on her but to my embarrassment I had to explain to her that I was just sneaking off a night to catch the latest episode of Star Wars Resistance.  

This year is going to be even tough for me and my family who will all be forced to watch the Mandalorian then I will force them to head out on a cold December night to watch Star Wars episode 9.

"I‚Äôve finished The Clone Wars, but I have a question about the ending??? Thoughts??","Overall, amazing series and I actually think Season 6 is my favorite. We learned so much that‚Äôs relevant to the actual movies in this season (that‚Äôs not to say that we didn‚Äôt in the other seasons). I‚Äôm really happy I took a leap of faith into what I‚Äôve called ‚ÄúCrap-Star Wars‚Äù since 2008. This is a must watch for all Star Wars fans. 

NOW MY QUESTION IS... did they imply that Luke was the chosen one at the end when the phrase ‚Äúthere is another Skywalker‚Äù was repeated or was this just added because those are Yoda‚Äôs dying words? I interpreted it as Anakin is not the chosen one, rather, the one who needs to create the chosen one‚Äîa vessel per se. Yoda‚Äôs sole purpose in learning the secret to immortality was to teach it to the chosen one, right? He taught it to Anakin (presumably), yes, and I‚Äôm going to assume he taught it to Luke because Mark Hamill is casted for Episode IX. Could this mean that Luke is going to play a bigger role as a force ghost in Episode IX? Are we going to see a force ghost do more than burn down a tree or say ‚Äúfrom a certain point of view?‚Äù 

All in all, I saw this as a fitting conclusion to the show. I only wish an episode existed this season to wrap up the Darth Maul story. This ending Yoda arc was a terrific ending for the show.

Is this the Best Year to be a Star Wars Fan?,"So 2015 will obviously always be special because it signalled the return of Star Wars with TFA (regardless of what you might have thought of the movie, the hype and the resurgence of the franchise was always going to make it a special year). However taking that and parking it for a moment I think this is shaping up to be the best year for Star Wars Fans.

So we are getting the end of the Skywalker saga, we are getting the Mandalorian, we are getting what I am cautiously optimistic could be the best game since Disney took over Star Wars. Along with that we have books like Master and Apprentice and I am really excited about Alphabet Squadron. Not only that but this early in the year I think it's safe to say that we are going to be getting some more announcements about other books and comics that will be coming and it seems possible we might also be getting TCW season 7.

I know how divided this fandom can be at times but really, can anyone think of a time when we had this much Star Wars to get excited about?","Is this the Best Year to be a Star Wars Fan?

Financing Jedi order,"How do you think Jedi order earned funds necessary to run the temple, travel expenses, equipment, new ships and probably quite expensive search for new talents?

As I imagine it there few possible options: 

Jedi order was subsidiaries with funds from republic budget. Probably with some permanently allocated sum for their services to republic. This seems as best option, but on the other hand that would make than dependent on galactic politics and they could have been hit with budget cuts in case of galactic economical crisis. They would also probably have to submit their bills to some accounting control and negotiate in senate  if they want grant on some extra activities which are not in day to day budget, like upgrading temple. 

Second option (maybe as addition to republic grants) is that they could crowdfund money on some galactic go fund me between their supporters or rich people. Problem is, that this kind of funding would be quite unstable and they can‚Äôt really relay on that.

Third option is some kind of special ‚Äúpeace tax‚Äù,  paid by republican population that goes directly to temple. Model similar to British TV tax. 

They could also have some portfolio of properties on Coruscant acquired in early ages of republic when it wasn‚Äôt so developed and much cheaper, which they now lease.

My favourite option, even though it is least possible is, that Jedi grounds were extraterritorial grounds as native tribes grounds in US. So they could have run legal casinos in Jedi owned buildings.

"I've been trying to look at the OT with 'fresh' eyes, and I wonder: Are there any canon concepts/characters/etc introduced in the OT that you dislike? Nit picks?","For me it's Force spirits (or Force ghosts). I just feel the concept is a cheap plot device, a convenient 'get out of jail free card' of sorts, that writers can cling to when it comes to re-using characters that have already been killed, to help develop current characters.

* Obi-Wan's ""Use the force Luke"" - Couldn't Luke have used the force on his own, figured this out somehow? Intuition?

* Spirit Obi-Wan talking to Yoda in Dagobah - Again, a cheap way to get plot/character exposition (about what Yoda thinks) and get things going. It would be far more interesting to just see Yoda struggling alone or just have him discussing things with Luke.

* The 3 spirits who give Luke a nice closure at the end of epVI - A heart warming moment for sure, but again I feel like Luke could (should?) have this moment with Leia instead, have a talk about their father or the Force or something, or some other Luke scene.

* In The Last Jedi it just felt too cheap to have Yoda *spawn in* to help Luke deal with his misery. I actually like the scene (and love cute puppet Yoda as much as anyone else), but still. How much more 'Life Pro Tips' can Luke need at this point?

**TLDR**: It's a poor recourse IMO that whenever characters are in trouble, the writer can just 'spawn in' a wise mentor to help get things going. Is no dead Jedi ever actually dead?

Have there been any new ships mentioned in canon in the past year or so?,"I'm afraid I don't read many SW books or comics, though I really should. TLJ introduced a number of new ships for the Resistance and First Order, which I found very interesting, (I love Star Wars ships and fleets), and I was wondering if more new ships have been added to canon since then in the books or comics. I feel like there's still room for a lot more ship designs in the First Order and Resistance fleets, and we don't know very much at all about the New Republic Navy, especially in the years closer to TFA and TLJ. 

Honestly, though, I'd be interested to hear of new ships belonging to any faction; Old Republic, Rebel Alliance, Imperial... there used to be so many different, interesting ships in Legends, and while I'm sure it'll take a while for everyone's fleets to get fleshed out in the new canon, I'm looking forward to seeing it happen. The most noteworthy things I've seen in a while were part of a comic where they showed a Nebulon-K (first time I'd seen a canon image of one of them), and the T-85 X-Wing in the first episode of SW: Resistance, although I felt like the art style of that show left the design rather open to interpretation. Has anyone seen/read of anything else?","Have there been any new ships mentioned in canon in the past year or so? I'm afraid I don't read many SW books or comics, though I really should. TLJ introduced a number of new ships for the Resistance and First Order, which I found very interesting, (I love Star Wars ships and fleets), and I was wondering if more new ships have been added to canon since then in the books or comics.

My friends idea of how to improve The Prequels well following the same basic plot lines that movies do,"
Imagine a schism within the Council being lightly hinted at in TPM. Mace and Yoda the leaders of each. Mace wants the Jedi to have more power in the Republic while Yoda is very wary. AotC explores this more with the clone army. Mace jumps on it with the idea that Jedi Knights lead the troops. This is where that schism gets defined. Obi-Wan and Anakin are more with Yoda but they all recognize a need for this army. Palpatine councils Anakin and brings up the Jedi history. How they once learned the ways of the dark side, without embracing it but also not shunning it. This is reinforced with Obi-Wan while captured by Dooku. Then in ROTS, after Obi-Wan brings Anakin‚Äôs concerns to Yoda, Yoda realizes he must win over Windu. Windu of course is stubborn and is set on this new course of the Jedi. Obi is gone on his mission and does not fully make things right with Anakin on their farewell. You can still have that sweet sendoff, only certain things are left unsaid. Leave it as though if Obi told him he did take him seriously and Yoda did as well, maybe things would‚Äôve been different. Then with Yoda on assignment, Windu is the only elder to turn to when Palpatine reveals himself. Seizing power is a legitimate concern to have about Mace now, and with that, the line between Jedi and Sith is too blurred. And only one of the men has truly been a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and offers him what he seeks. Bam! His turn to the dark side.

Balance in the Force: What is it?,"To me it seems like we are getting conflicting definitions of what balance is. The Mortis Arc aand Bendu from Rebels seems to imply that balance is equal dark and equal light. Yet at the same time in the Mortis Arc, the Father hoped the Son wouldn't give in to the dark side.

There's also the fact that pretty much every dark side user was evil. They committed numerous atrocities. According to Lucas, the Force in its natural state was the light side, and the dark side was this unnatural cancer.

So which is it then? I don't believe balance is equal good and equal evil. Evil shouldn't exist in the first place, and it just sends a bad message to the audience (and the kids) who will watch it.","Balance in the Force: What is it?

"Genuine question for prequel era experts: What exactly was Luke referring to when he talks about ‚Äúthe failure of the Jedi order‚Äù ??? (Failure, hubris, hypocrisy etc...)","I have watched the last Jedi probably a dozen times now. But the one section of the film I need the subtitles on is for Luke‚Äôs second lesson. The one where he tells Rey about ‚Äúfailure of the Jedi‚Äù and how they allowed darth Vader to arise. Now I got that part.  Anakin‚Äôs fall is clearly explained in revenge of the Sith.

As for me I am making my way through the clone wars series for the first time. I never watched them. All I know about the prequel era is the three movies.

Phasma Book - Question about Cardinal,"I do not have the Phasma book, but I am aware that it contains a character called Cardinal, who wears unique red stormtrooper armour.

I am strongly considering a custom Black Series figure of Cardinal, as I already have one of Commander Pyre, and was wondering if the book makes any references to his height. Obviously, Phasma is taller than most, if not all, of the regular stormtroopers, so I'm wondering if I should be using Phasma as a base figure, or a Stormtrooper. I'll likely need both to make the custom anyway.","Phasma Book - Question about Cardinal I do not have the Phasma book, but I am aware that it contains a character called Cardinal, who wears unique red stormtrooper armour.

The Last Skywalker,"I‚Äôve seen this title prediction pop up only a couple of times on social media. As an Episode 9 title prediction I think ‚ÄòThe Last Skywalker‚Äô is the most realistic. 

First, Episode 9 is the end of the Skywalker saga, meaning this is the end of Star Wars. Or the Skywalker trilogy at least (I know about the GOT writer‚Äôs trilogy). So to end the saga, I believe it should include the words ‚Äòend or last‚Äô or at least include words relating to ‚Äòend‚Äô like finale for example. Just like ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame‚Äô features ‚Äúend‚Äù. 

Second, there are literally only two Skywalkers left: Kylo Ren and Leia. I heard a rumour a while back that the ending will be very similar to one of the older Disney movies which I remember some people hinted at Pocahontas. So what if Rey and Kylo have one last duel at the end and Kylo dies? OR, Leia is very old so what if she dies leaving Kylo Ren as the last Skywalker? Or maybe they could finish the pattern. The pattern where Han dies in TFA, Luke died in TLJ so Leia dies in Episode 9? Just a thought. 

Third, I‚Äôve seen many other predictions such as ‚Äòbalance of the force‚Äô and ‚Äòthe will of the force‚Äô. I doubt those will be the titles simply because in my opinion they sound far too dramatic. But mainly because this is the last skywalker film so the title has to make the movie feel like the end. ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame‚Äù certainly sounds like the end to me. ‚ÄòBalance of the force‚Äô doesn‚Äôt sound like an ending. That sounds like it could introduce a bunch of new ideas for another few movies where Rey and Kylo have a child creating episode 10 where another Villain rises out of the blue and they have to protect it or something. Point is, those two titles doesn‚Äôt feel like an end to me, more like an opportunity for more movies, not an ending.

EpIX theory I haven‚Äôt heard before,"I‚Äôm normally the guy who quietly laughs at some of the fan theories I read here, not the guy writing them - but this one has been building in my mind and thought I would share it.

We keep hearing that JJ will tie the entire skywalker saga together with IX. This is I believe a cool (but unlikely) way it could be done;

In TPM, we learned that Anikan ‚Äúhad no father‚Äù. Many people took this as confirmation of immaculate conception/birth through the force.  At the time of viewing I took it as, the guys dad left and never came back.

What if the later is true, and Anikan‚Äôs father is off in another part of the galaxy and eventually has another family. What if Rey is descendant of this line? Neat little way to make her a Skywalker, explains her ‚ÄúAnikan like power‚Äù and connection to Kyle. Also ties up the saga nicely.

I know it‚Äôs very random. But I haven‚Äôt heard a theory like this before and though I would share. Feel free to attack it/pull it apart.","EpIX theory I haven‚Äôt heard before I‚Äôm normally the guy who quietly laughs at some of the fan theories I read here, not the guy writing them - but this one has been building in my mind and thought I would share it.

(Discussion) Are there any real-life people that Kylo Ren shares similarities with?,"Listen, I'm doing this for research purposes. 

And by real-life people, I mean famous political leaders (dictators included) and monarchs. 

The only two people I could think of are Kim Jong-un and Justin Trudeau. 

Let me know if you have any other suggestions, guys.","(Discussion) Are there any real-life people that Kylo Ren shares similarities with? Listen, I'm doing this for research purposes.

Can't get in to rebels,"Loved original movies, prequels were ok but the thing I love more about star wars is the extended universe especially the games like kotr, swtor, republic commando, the books and more recently the spin off series clone wars. I am super late to the party when it comes to these and only just finished it and thought I'd give rebels a look. I binged the first season but starting the second I don't feel drawn into it. I know it's aimed at kids (I'm 30M) but so was clone wars and it seemed more wholesome, better characters, plot seemed higher stakes. I don't know exactly. Anyone else have the same feeling and should I push through the lull and get to s3?","Can't get in to rebels Loved original movies, prequels were ok but the thing I love more about star wars is the extended universe especially the games like kotr, swtor, republic commando, the books and more recently the spin off series clone wars.

Why do Star Wars fan always believe the characters in the movies?,"I'll explain what I mean. Every time someone in the movies says something, the fans never seem to question whether they are lying or not. I will bring a couple of exemples. In the original trilogy  the main characters of the movie respect Jabba as a powerful individual. In episode 6 Luke speaks to him trough the hologram as an ""exalted one"" and a powerful being. Why did no one of the fanbase think Jabba just wanted to be recognized as a meaningful being while in reality he was just a C-tier villain who just had control over Tatooine and a couple of commercial route? Of course after the trilogy got expanded with the prequels and novels etc. we saw that he was in fact very powerful but just because the story writers made him that way. Because he became an iconic figure in the universe and they decided to actually give him the power. They could have just as easily made him a mere puppet of a greater character of the galaxy (maybe someone not mentioned in the OT) and it would have been a completely different deal.

Another example I want to bring you is Snoke. In TLJ he said he was the one connecting Kylo and Rey with the force. Why didn't anyone think he could be lying just to show himself more powerful in the force than he actually is?

One last example. Do you know the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise? Couldn't Palpatine be lying about the power of keeping people from dying? What if Darth Plagueis actually didn't have such power. After all he is trying to seduce Anakin into the dark side and he is a Sith Lord, master of deceive that manipulates people at will. 

Maybe people just always want to believe because its amusing to think about all those great character and their powers. But what if sometimes, when a character is expanded upon in canon stories (comics, novels, series or even movies), that character turns out different than what he said he was?

I like Rey more when she can't immeadiately overpower problems with the force,"Its fun to see how resourceful she is as a survivor, negotiator and tinkerer in TFA, she comes across as a very strong, driven and intelligent person. Then her powers manifest and all those interesting aspects get replaced with a giant problem solving hammer, where the hammer is the force and the force solves all.

Trapped in a room? Hammer time

It's not until they take the hammer away in the third act of the last jedi that rey finally has time with the force where it cant solve problems without help and the team up is awesome. But then the ending throws that away and it's back to hammer time.

It would be cool if rey earned the right to wield a plot hammer for ep 9 like Sateele from the old republic exacting revenge on malgus, but 7 and 8 was supposed to set that up and its been quite a mixed bag where sometimes its on the right track before veering way off course.","I like Rey more when she can't immeadiately overpower problems with the force Its fun to see how resourceful she is as a survivor, negotiator and tinkerer in TFA, she comes across as a very strong, driven and intelligent person.

Star Wars needs some kind of live-action vignette/short story collection similar to The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.,"I think it would be a great way to explore the many eras of the saga without devoting all of the resources and time required to make an entire season of a show. Each episode could run from 15-20 minutes and feature a little Star Wars parable. 

Also, it would be a great way for some actors and directors to return to the franchise.

We could have an Obi-Wan and Anakin episodes with Ewan and Hayden as they go through a mission during the Clone Wars. Maybe even include a live-action Ashoka and Ventress for the very first time! 

Another episode could follow Mace Windu, because we all know Samuel L. Jackson wants to return to the role, and has expressed his interest. He could have a short story similar to Shatterpoint, and feature voice-over narration, and Windu being a badass. 

Ian McDiarmad reprising his role to show what really happened with his master that night! 

Ray Park returning as Maul pre-TPM! 

We could even have a chapter about Bossk, Boba, and other bounty hunters, the Mos Eisely cantina, the possibilities are endless! 

And most of all, maybe the creator himself, George Lucas, can return to the franchise and direct a story or few!!! Are you listening, Disney?

Star Wars Reading List: Post Return of the Jedi - Legends (Updated),"Here is a link to a Google Doc I made last year and just updated.

&amp;#x200B;

Included is a list of all the adult novels set after Return of the Jedi in chronological order. I've also included a few Young Adult books and comics if I feel they're important to the timeline.

Each title includes a link to information on Good Reads, whether I personally recommend reading it, and if I think it's essential to the timeline. There are also some links to other resources that I think would be helpful.

So if you've ever wanted to dive into the books set after Return of the Jedi, then I hope you find this helpful. I'll continue to update the list when I can as I read more stuff.

Also feel free to let me know if you see anything missing!","Star Wars Reading List: Post Return of the Jedi - Legends (Updated) Here is a link to a Google Doc I made last year and just updated.

Star Wars book recommendation,"I'm looking to indulge in my first SW book. I'm fairly aware of common titles and authors that have recently come out such as 

- Lost Stars

- Inferno Squad 

- Aftermath Trilogy

- Queen's Shadow

Now having said that, I want a story that enriches any character or movie in the series or the video games. Preferably anything Prequel or OT but open to other options.

I mean genuine suggestions. What would you want to see as a satisfying conclusion to Luke, Rey and Ben's character arcs taking into account the events so far? How would you end the Skywalker series in a way that redeems the flaws of TLJ?

I personally have a very mixed opinion on that movie. On the one hand the visuals and designs are amazing, the acting is solid and the plot itself isn't terrible when looked at from a distance, it's the execution that was poor. Luke's arc for me is disappointing but understandable at the same time, I wanted an OP Jedi master but it made sense for him to pass on the failures of the Jedi to future generations so they don't make the same mistakes.","For those of you disillusioned with Star Wars in the direction it is taking under Disney, I have a question: What would have to happen to turn around your opinion on the sequel trilogy?

Something I want to see in future star wars,"Ships. The last 2 movies have been good for my nostalgia, in showing the Milineum falcon, TIE Fighters, X-wings all that Jazz. But my favorite part of the prequels, and when I watched the original trilogy, was seeing new ships that made me say ""wow!"" And ""oooo!"" And even ""pretty!"" And these last 3 movies didn't do that for me. The rogue one movie got away with it in my book by showing me a new droid with K2SO. Maybe I'm the only one, but I hope to see a new style of starship in the newest installment of the franchise. Also, if there are any, I'd love to see some people make fanart of ship designs that could be in a starwars movie. Unfortunately I am not very artistic.

But my favorite part of the prequels, and when I watched the original trilogy, was seeing new ships that made me say ""wow!"" And ""oooo!"" And even ""pretty!"" And these last 3 movies didn't do that for me. The rogue one movie got away with it in my book by showing me a new droid with K2SO. Maybe I'm the only one, but I hope to see a new style of starship in the newest installment of the franchise. Also, if there are any, I'd love to see some people make fanart of ship designs that could be in a starwars movie. Unfortunately I am not very artistic. I'd just end up drawing stick figures, but if anyone sees any fanart stuff like that, then please comment or private message me that stuff. That's the end of my rant about starships! "

(My Thoughts) The next trilogy is NOT in the Old Republic,"Am I crazy for thinking this? They have stated that it's taking place ""hundreds of years"" before the Skywalker saga, if I'm not mistaken. The Old Republic is set some 3600 years BEFORE the Skywalker saga, according to Wookiepedia, which unless by hundreds they mean tens-of-hundreds means that it's not going to be set in the Old Republic that we know and love, but rather a mere few generations before the saga. 

Am I being too pessimistic, or is everyone just stretching and being too optimistic? ","(My Thoughts) The next trilogy is NOT in the Old Republic Am I crazy for thinking this?

We Really Need a Game of Throne‚Äôs Style Show About the Mandalorians,"I know the new show is about a Mandalorian away from Mandalore doing his own thing. But after rewatching Rebels and currently doing a rewatch of Game of Thrones the potential a Mandalorian themed show like Game of Thrones would be awesome.

Have it almost exclusively set in Mandalorian space with Mandalore and Concordia and Concord Dawn and Krownest. Bring back some other Mandalorian planets from legends like Phindar and Ordo and Mandallia etc.

We could see the clans and houses. Like House Vizsla with Clan Wren and Clan Saxon under them. Clan Fett and Clan Skirata. House Kryze as well.

It would be absolutely amazing seeing a similar set up showing the different houses and clans and how they fight one another. I think it would work perfect if it was nothing during any other event we have seen or heard of before so like before the movies but not during the Mandalorian wars either. A new time period never explored in Mandalorian history. Something like this would be huge and I don‚Äôt see how anyone wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it","We Really Need a Game of Throne‚Äôs Style Show About the Mandalorians I know the new show is about a Mandalorian away from Mandalore doing his own thing.

Why were the mandalorians afraid of the empire?,The mandalorians are the one group of people that you would think wouldn't put up with imperial oppression but instead they cowered at the very mention of the empire.  Why were the mandalorians so afraid of the empire.  During the mandalorian  wars they conquered most of the outer rim and nearly brought the republic to it's knees.  And yet they're afraid of the empire.  That doesn't make much sense.  True the mandelorian wars was almost four thousand years before the films.  But they don't seem to have changed that much since then.  Of course eventually they tell the empire where they can stick it but only after the empire has been around for almost two decades.  Anyway I was just surprised to see mandalorians afraid of anything.,Why were the mandalorians afraid of the empire?

How to run a planetary blockade,We see in rebels that when they go up against a planetary blockade they usually lose.  There is a really simple way to get past a planetary blockade that they seem to be overlooking.  Delay dropping out of hyperspace until your in the atmosphere.  Han solo did this in the force awakens.  So why isn't this used more often.  True you risk hitting a star destroyer but it's far more likely you would crash into the ground.  Still the odds are better then taking on a group of star destroyers head on.  As desperate as the rebels are you would think you would see them use strategies like this.  As for getting past a blockade after leaving a planet's surface there is way to do it.  Do a blind jump into hyperspace.  Space is mostly empty so the chances of you hitting something are negligible.  Drop out of hyperspace after a few seconds and then calculate your next jump and be on your way.  So I just find it ridiculous that the rebels would try to engage imperial ships on the blockade instead of using these methods of getting past them.,How to run a planetary blockade We see in rebels that when they go up against a planetary blockade they usually lose.

Why did some clone troopers have markings on their armor and some didn't?,"I'm not sure if this has been posted here before, but I wanted to know. Some clone groups like the 41st ranger platoon, or the 212th attack battalion, or the 501st had their own color. (or in the 41sts case, camouflage) but did all republic army groups like this have their own unique color scheme? Was it as simple as personal choice? A side question I also had was why it seems like the Republic made the switch from having clone armor color go from designating rank, to being for specific legions/battalions/platoons.","Why did some clone troopers have markings on their armor and some didn't?

"So, about this fuel thing...","I'm all for criticizing Last Jedi. I generally like a lot of its big ideas and character stuff, but it definitely has some issues.

The fuel is not one of them. Can we just kinda come to an agreement on that?

Fuel has been a plot point before. Hell, it's been an important one. The obvious one that comes to mind is after Qui-Gon and company escape Naboo and need to ""refuel and repair"".

Literally, the only reason Anakin Skywalker is discovered is because they were leaking fuel. I'd say that's kinda important.

But, what do you guys think on the fuel thing? Out of all of the potential criticisms of TLJ I've heard, that just seems like one of the weirdest ones to latch onto.","So, about this fuel thing...

Dooku interpretation: Lee VS Burton,"Do you think the two actors have interpreted Dooku differently at all? It seems to me that Sir Christopher Lee played him as still clinging, in part, to the respectability he had in the Jedi order and that it was him who had the moral high ground and the Jedi's who had lost their way. Corey Burton seems to have Dooku fully embrace villain status. If you compare Lee vs Burton speaking the line, ""I've been looking forward to this"", Lee's sounds like he's been looking forward to the sport aspect of it where as Burton's is positively sinister, sounds like he is trying to intimidate them and that he will take great pleasure in cutting them apart. I personally like Dooku being more vicious and cruel as Burton plays him. Christopher Lee was / is one of my favourite actors and possessed an epic voice and presence, don't get me wrong.

Is it just me or does ryloth seem a lot more underdeveloped and primitive in the new EU compared to Legends?,"I really started thinking of then when I was reading Bloodline and they were talking about how they were so poor/put down that they had to keep all of their information on bark, leather, and paper. Their was also mention of them having to buy most of their ships and resources from other planets. 

Ryloth hasn't appeared that many times in the NEU and the rendering limitations of Rebels and TCW could be to blame but even when we see their cities/towns they are small one room adobe huts with not much in them. Though again this could just be a rendering thing where models are really simple and their isn't much environmental clutter. 

Idk, I just feel like while they were still under the thumb of the Hutts in Legends they were shown to be a little more on par with the rest of the galaxy instead of really far behind. Even tattooine seems more advanced. 

I know the Hutts had more control over Ryloth in the NEU than they did in Legends so maybe that had something to do with it.

Also while I can not find it on wookieepedia I feel like their was something that changed when they came to the Republic in the NEU vs Legends. It said about three thousand years ago meaning no Mission Vao or Tott Doneeta or any other twilikes running around in the old republic.  

IDK part of me feels like they have been turned into some undeveloped third world..world to me. But their is so little to really go on its hard to tell. What do you guys think?
