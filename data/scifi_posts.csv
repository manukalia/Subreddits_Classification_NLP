The goal is to keep this subreddit as spam free as possible and we all know how easy it is to game the system. To that end, we've restricted self-promotion to Saturdays.

I just watched Oblivion yet again. I love this movie.," 

I love this movie flaws and all, or what I think are flaws but maybe they're not flaws, who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

For  one why run right to Earth when the Tet with its vast technology  could  stripmine all the gas giants in our solar system for less cost and  not  have to defend itself or attack anyone? Why jump right to Earth?

&amp;#x200B;

Also  who built the fancy towers that defy gravity and the aircraft all  the  clones fly? If the Tet could do that it can bloody well look after   itself and had zero need for the elaborate plan which was bound to fail.    For one it cloned the Jack's so well that their original memories   began to surface with little effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Just  it's a fun movie, I love it but it has things that jump right out at  you that even on multiple viewings I notice but I let it slide because  it's a fun movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway can we talk about it?

Anyone else think Stargate Universe was the best Stargate series?,"I enjoyed SG-1 although it got weaker in the Ori seasons but thought SGA was an average rehash overall without much creativity.

SGU was refreshing after 15 seasons of lighthearted episodic stories. I appreciated the more flawed human characters, serious tone and focus on survival and mystery instead of a clear cartoony evil bad guy and repetitive exploration of samey looking planets.

It got too much hate from fans of the franchise who just wanted more of the same instead of being open to something new so sadly it failed and was cancelled. Huge shame tbh","Anyone else think Stargate Universe was the best Stargate series?

Sources or pathology of satisfaction for Artificial Intelligence...?,"I saw some Matrix stuff in the press lately and on the sub and it got me thinking. When Smith looks to be defeating Neo, or when he's exacting torture on Morpheus, he seems to be enjoying it and taking satisfaction in his skill and their suffering. Smith isn't the only AI or program represented in Sci Fi as having these sorts of emotions, but unlike Replicants in BR or the like, he doesn't seem to have emotions informed by implanted memories. 

How would we explain his ability to become frustrated? I am using Smith as an example but am interested in any character that is both non human, not conditioned by memories, and displaying things like sadism in any other sci fi universe. How might this be explained?","Sources or pathology of satisfaction for Artificial Intelligence...? I saw some Matrix stuff in the press lately and on the sub and it got me thinking.

Looking for partners to start an online science fiction magazine!,"Haven't had much luck in other subs, maybe here there's interest! 

So here's the deal: I'd like to start a bi-monthy (or monthly) ""hard"" science fiction online magazine. By hard I mean the science fiction needs to be plausible in our universe, and not fantasy. I can create and manage the website where the magazine would be published, and so your tasks would involve minor editing of the stories, and reading all of the submissions we get to decide which of them we would publish. This is not time-demanding at all, especially if the magazine is bi-monthly.

Perhaps the important part for most people reading this would be that partners would have to help me pay (equally among all) the writers for their quality stories. I explain the amounts below.

So, in short, I'm looking for partners who:

- Are passionate about science fiction (plausible/hard science fiction, in particular), and would want to help create an online magazine.
- Are willing to read story submissions, decide on their favorite stories, and can help pay authors (dividing equally among all partners, currently just myself). 
- Payment of authors is debatable, my idea was something like 4 cents per word, with the average story being ~5000 words long, and each issue of the magazine having 3 stories to begin with.
 
If there's any questions feel free to ask! I hope there's interest (:","Looking for partners to start an online science fiction magazine! Haven't had much luck in other subs, maybe here there's interest!

Presenting my Scifi Fantasy project - Everdream: Stars Hold No Boundaries.,"Hello, I'd like to show y'all my sci-fi/fantasy webcomic that I've been working on since february of 2018. It's a passion project about the story of a girl in a very, very distant future. Her name is Cozmata and she lives with her adoptive mom and her aunt in a planet called Juuna. It is a lighthearted story about Cozmata getting involved on things much bigger than her, and having to rely on her family and those close to her to get past it. It is inspired by famous titles of sci-fi, fantasy and even slice of life like Star Wars, Destiny, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls and Hilda.

There is tonnes of separate lore that I've created for the universe, including the Federo-Etherian War, the Cloud Theocracy and many other very interesting concepts I intend on implementing one way or another in future chapters.

Anyway, enough bragging! Here's the link if any of you want to check it out:

This novel was hard to define, as it reads like a fantasy, but there's no supernatural element. I would define it as an Urban Fantasy with a Steampunk-vibe instead of a Mystical one.

For me, the best fiction has always been one where you can turn off the movie, or put down the book and say: ""Now, can I prove it isn't a true story?""

In an effort to drive up interest/sales; I have also put the complete book up on my blog, [chapter by chapter](https://matt-stephens.blogspot.com/p/the-lostkind-table-of-contents-page.html). Try before you buy.

And if you do happen to enjoy it, but don't want to buy, can I ask that you take the time to spread the word, instead? Tell a friend, request a copy for your local library, or post a review on Amazon. All these options are free; and would be greatly appreciated.","[Self-Promo Saturday] The Lostkind, now available to read before you buy! Submitted for your approval, a speculative fiction novel.

Help! I can't remember what character I'm thinking of and what book he came from!,"The character and scenario I can recall:

* This president (of the universe? I think) is the person who wants it the least. He hates his job. Lives in solitude on a planet and rules greatly despite his lack of want for the position. I think he lives in a tiny hut?



I think this is from the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, but I honestly cannot remember, nor does any of my ""google-fu"" return results on that besides SO many articles about Trump. If this was HHGttG, then it was most certainly in one of the later books. ","Help! I can't remember what character I'm thinking of and what book he came from!

Who is the Mystery Girl?

Bernard Abbey’s life was routine, stagnant, and lonely. That all changed the day she entered his life. To save him from being killed, a mysterious young woman transports Bernard to another point in time. As he comes to grips with what has happened, Bernard realizes his new friend is unable to speak. She cannot tell him who she is, where she came from, or how she can travel through time. Even worse, she’s unable to tell him what is chasing her.

As she takes him back and forth in time, they cross paths with strangers who claim to know his new friend, each with a different story of her origin. The only thing he knows for certain is that the fate of humanity’s idyllic future is somehow connected with his new companion.

"Trilogy where everyone had a virtual AI personal assistant Avatar, from the mid-2000s...?","Hi everyone!

I read through the rules and, unless I missed something, I hope this post doesn't go against them... if it does, or if there's a better place to ask, do let me know!

In the mid-2000s I remember reading a book where everyone had virtual AI personal assistants. These assistants had Avatars, and communicated with one another.
Each of these assistants might have had a name - the name of one of them is right under my tongue, but I really can't recall it... Might have been related to greek mythology, or something like that? I really don't know.

As far as I remember it was a book trilogy, and at that time the third book had not been published yet - or, at least, it hadn't been translated into my language yet. So that's why I believe it was published somewhere in the mid-2000s.

I don't remember anything of the plot, or names, or locations. I vaguely remember that things started going wrong in this virtual world... The vague image of ""boxes with viruses"" come to mind, but it might be gibberish :)

I tried a lot of Google searches, but came up empty - as far as I remember, this was never hugely popular. At least I don't remember seeing it discussed anywhere, and nothing came up on Google.

I know it's a super long shot, but maybe someone knows what I'm talking about?

I'd love to remember what this trilogy was, and pick it back up again!

Either way, thank you all in advance, and have an awesome day!","Trilogy where everyone had a virtual AI personal assistant Avatar, from the mid-2000s...? Hi everyone!

Crescendians

======

Biology

=======

A Race of Humanoids that closely resembles Humanity but with the Destructive Ability to manipulate and control Gravity and Magnetic Powers

&amp;#x200B;

They have 2 hands and 2 legs and they are nearly indistinguishable due to appearance but organ wise, they are different from humans

&amp;#x200B;

Crescendians typically conceal and suppress their powers and only use it when necessary

&amp;#x200B;

Only a Crescendian is ever seen and is part of UFS Starfleet as a Science Officer

&amp;#x200B;

========

Origins

========

The Crescendians were once a Vast Powerful Empire that exists in the Gamma Quadrant until the Rise of the Grolls, once a biological speices that became a race of Asimilating Robots, it started small but became a uncontrollable threat, many worlds devoured by Groll Harversters and entire population hubs assimilated, the Military waged a bloody war againts the Groll but they lost the war, in the final days of the War, the Groll encroaches Cresta the original Crescendian Homeworld, 50 Worldships guarded by 30 Imperius Class Battleships fled to deep space while the remnants of the military fought to the bitter end, ground combat wise the Crescendians fare better due to thier Manipulation of gravity and Magnetic Powers, 1 Crescendian is equivalent to 10 Groll Drones, but in space the advantage goes to the Grolls, Massive Groll War Cubes that are immune to any form of weapons that the Crescendians can throw at them, resulting in Severe losses. By the time they created the necessary countermeasures, it was too late as the Groll was practically at their door step, the only ship with the countermeasures will go on to inspire the Crescendians to build the Legion Class Strikeships.

&amp;#x200B;

As the small fleet escaped to deep space, Cresta has fallen, the Empire was no more.

&amp;#x200B;

Cast away from the Gamma Quadrant, the Crescendians Travelled among the Stars searching for a new home (the Milky Way in my version is far larger) as centuries passed Worldships by worldships were destroyed or disbanded, one by one, the Battleship Escorts fell into disrepair and constant pirate attacks until the fleet discovered a Wormhole that will collapse but it will transport them to the Beta Quadrant, as centuries passed while they travel towards the Wormhole, the surviving Worldships combine themselves into one massive Worldship for a better chance of survival, within that long timeframe, the ship lost access to it's computer drive when a Power surge destroyed it, erasing Centuries Worth of information including thier History, despite the Severe Lost, the surviving Crescendians passed on their knowledge of Technology to future generations so they can use it once they found a home, but the History of the Crescendians were but completely forgotten

&amp;#x200B;

After so many Generations passed, by the time they cross the Wormhole, it transported them to the Beta Quadrant and the Wormhole collapsed, they striked the lottery, they were in a area of space, so full of resources they decided to settle down and the entire Species begin building a massive construct by tearing down the Combined Worldship, creating a massive Singularity Neutron Reactor using the Reactors from the many Worldships, they continued building in a fast pace and within a Year they constructed ""Crest"" thier new Homeworld, finally settling down, the Crescendians begin laying claim to surrounding Stars and eventually they formed the now modern Crescsius Empire

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughout the Centuries, the Crescsius Empire contacted many speices but kept a closed Borders stance, they were held in High Regards by the Altairian

&amp;#x200B;

In the final days of the Dominion War, the Allied Fleet was above the Clardassian Homeworld (my version of Cardassians), facing a massive fleet of Jana'dar and Windaxian ships, the Crescsius Empire finally joins the war and assisted the allies in winning the final battle, ending the Dominion War

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

====================

Military Forces and Defense

====================

The Standing Military Force of the Crescsius Empire is the War Fleet consisting of 15 000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

Defending the Empire is the Guardian Fleet consisting of 24 000 Strikeships, the same kind of ship used by the War Fleet

&amp;#x200B;

And defending the Empire's Home System and Capital is the Praetorian Fleet consisting of 8000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

The Military only uses one type of ship which is the Legion Class Strikeship which is based from the designs of the Imperius Class Battleships, the ancient ships that escorted the many Crescendian Worldships as they were finding a new home, unlike other Galactic Powers like the Kahlesia Empire (my version of the Klingons) or the UFS (my version of the Federation) which possesses mulitple ship classes, the Legion Class has been used by the Empire for Centuries and has remained as thier main Workhorse, winning Multiple wars, they are very heavily Shielded and Armored and Armed and is about the length of a Galaxy Class and Firepower that rivals both the Prometheus Class or Defiant Class and the Triumph Card of the Legion Class is their Shields and weapons are undetectable and leaves behind no energy traces and is also unadaptable by Groll Technology (my version of the Borg)

&amp;#x200B;

Strikeship Specs

Crew = 4600

Propulsion = 4 Gravity Impulse Drives, 2 Class 9 warp cores

Weapons = 8 Dimensional Wave Strips, 4 Frontal Torpedo and 2 back Torpedo

Defense = Double Layer Unimatrix Shield Grid, 20 Meter Heavy Composite Allow Composition Armor

Weakness = very slow combat speed and turning rate

&amp;#x200B;

============

Technology

============

The Crescendians posses Advanced Technologies that rivals the UFS or the Kahlesia or the Dominion, they posses Advanced Replicator Facilities that are able to recreate none Crescendian Technology with ease, and they were able to Replicate a Hermes Class Explorer (JJprise USS Kelvin) molecules to molecules, wires by wires, Everything, all within just a Hour

&amp;#x200B;

The most greatest Technological Advancements they achieved is Mega Colossal Stellar Engineering, they were able to build Crest, the Capital World, within JUST a Year and improved thier Technology and go on to build multiple Artificial Worlds WITHIN MONTHS across the Crescsius Empire  while it took a massive Combined Collaboration of the UFS and the Kahlesia Empire and 4 other Major Galactic Powers, 50 YEARS to build Starbase Unity (my version of Starbase Yorktown). Not even the Groll or Dominion can do such advanced feats

&amp;#x200B;

======================

Crescsius Empire Capital

====================

""Crest""

The Crescendian Capital, a massive Artificial Construct that is far bigger (larger then Starbase Yorktown, ST Beyond) then Earth and it's the Center of Crescendian Power and Sovereignty

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Population Size

There's an Estimated 360,000,000,000 Souls living in Crest, which is 40 Percent of the Entire Crescendian Species

&amp;#x200B;

The population is more the UFS's Starbase Unity

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Infarstructure

the Center of the Construct is a Singularity Neutron Power Core that powers the entire Homeworld, the Construct contains a Artificial Atmosphere Regulated by 6 Atmospheric Towers and Lush Gardens and Fields across the surface and many Business and Cooperate Cities and a Exposed Naval Pier covered only by a Colossal Blast Door which houses 8000 ships, the Praetorian Fleet protecting Crest, while beneath the Surface houses the Vast Population Hubs and Recreation Centers and deeper nearer the Core houses the vast Replicator Factories and Assembly Plants and Laboratories and also contains a Massive Naval Pier that houses 15 000 ships, the Crescendian War Fleet and Vast Barracks and Training Centers for Soldiers and at the very center is the Power Core

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Planetary Defenses

Guarding Crest is a Network of Heavily Armed Satellites that protect Crest, followed by a Outer Planetary Shield that covers the entire Capital World and is controlled by 6 Orbital Shield Generators with only a single entrance guarded by a Heavily Armed Fortress that acts as Custom Control for ships in and out of the Capital while acting as a Civilian Shipyard and Trading Center and contains mulitple Shopping Centers and Hotels

&amp;#x200B;

Within Crest itself the Artificial World is also protected by a Planetary Sheild that is cushioned right above the Magnetic Sphere that keeps the Atmosphere of Crest breathable, space between the Shield and the Outer Planetary Shield is quite far, which is far enough that many Youngsters like to fly to that area and recreate famous dogfights, a constant nuisance for the Police, besides the Shields, the entire Surface contains a massive Network of Guns that can fire Repulsor Beams to ward away ships or Gravitational Beams to Vaporise entire Fleets, one gun is enough to destroy a Fully Shielded Fully Tactical Modified Galaxy Class in one Shot at low power and the Artificial World posses a Total of 100 000 spread across the Surface

&amp;#x200B;

A massive fleet of 8000 Warships defends the Artificial World and the Crescia System from Intruders or Invaders

&amp;#x200B;

Combining all of it's Defenses makes Crest arguably the most Heavily Fortified and Heavily Defended and Heavily Populated World in all of the Milky Way

&amp;#x200B;

The Defense Satellites are nested in-between the Outer Planetary Shield and Inner Planetary Shield

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Crest is very Similar to Coruscant from Star Wars the only difference is Coruscant is originally a Planet but Crest is entirely Artificial, there's little to no Green Grass spots in Coruscant but there's large Continent sized Grass Lands and Forests on Crest

&amp;#x200B;

Another difference is Coruscant is a City Planet, completely covered by cities and no empty lands, while Crest is only 40% covered by Cities

&amp;#x200B;

The only Artificial Object of similar strength is Starbase Unity which is also guarded by a Network of Satellites and Surface Guns

They have 2 hands and 2 legs and they are nearly indistinguishable due to appearance but organ wise, they are different from humans

&amp;#x200B;

Crescendians typically conceal and suppress their powers and only use it when necessary

&amp;#x200B;

Only a Crescendian is ever seen and is part of UFS Starfleet as a Science Officer

&amp;#x200B;

========

Origins

========

The Crescendians were once a Vast Powerful Empire that exists in the Gamma Quadrant until the Rise of the Grolls, once a biological speices that became a race of Asimilating Robots, it started small but became a uncontrollable threat, many worlds devoured by Groll Harversters and entire population hubs assimilated, the Military waged a bloody war againts the Groll but they lost the war, in the final days of the War, the Groll encroaches Cresta the original Crescendian Homeworld, 50 Worldships guarded by 30 Imperius Class Battleships fled to deep space while the remnants of the military fought to the bitter end, ground combat wise the Crescendians fare better due to thier Manipulation of gravity and Magnetic Powers, 1 Crescendian is equivalent to 10 Groll Drones, but in space the advantage goes to the Grolls, Massive Groll War Cubes that are immune to any form of weapons that the Crescendians can throw at them, resulting in Severe losses. By the time they created the necessary countermeasures, it was too late as the Groll was practically at their door step, the only ship with the countermeasures will go on to inspire the Crescendians to build the Legion Class Strikeships.

&amp;#x200B;

As the small fleet escaped to deep space, Cresta has fallen, the Empire was no more.

&amp;#x200B;

Cast away from the Gamma Quadrant, the Crescendians Travelled among the Stars searching for a new home (the Milky Way in my version is far larger) as centuries passed Worldships by worldships were destroyed or disbanded, one by one, the Battleship Escorts fell into disrepair and constant pirate attacks until the fleet discovered a Wormhole that will collapse but it will transport them to the Beta Quadrant, as centuries passed while they travel towards the Wormhole, the surviving Worldships combine themselves into one massive Worldship for a better chance of survival, within that long timeframe, the ship lost access to it's computer drive when a Power surge destroyed it, erasing Centuries Worth of information including thier History, despite the Severe Lost, the surviving Crescendians passed on their knowledge of Technology to future generations so they can use it once they found a home, but the History of the Crescendians were but completely forgotten

&amp;#x200B;

After so many Generations passed, by the time they cross the Wormhole, it transported them to the Beta Quadrant and the Wormhole collapsed, they striked the lottery, they were in a area of space, so full of resources they decided to settle down and the entire Species begin building a massive construct by tearing down the Combined Worldship, creating a massive Singularity Neutron Reactor using the Reactors from the many Worldships, they continued building in a fast pace and within a Year they constructed ""Crest"" thier new Homeworld, finally settling down, the Crescendians begin laying claim to surrounding Stars and eventually they formed the now modern Crescsius Empire

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughout the Centuries, the Crescsius Empire contacted many speices but kept a closed Borders stance, they were held in High Regards by the Altairian

&amp;#x200B;

In the final days of the Dominion War, the Allied Fleet was above the Clardassian Homeworld (my version of Cardassians), facing a massive fleet of Jana'dar and Windaxian ships, the Crescsius Empire finally joins the war and assisted the allies in winning the final battle, ending the Dominion War

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

====================

Military Forces and Defense

====================

The Standing Military Force of the Crescsius Empire is the War Fleet consisting of 15 000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

Defending the Empire is the Guardian Fleet consisting of 24 000 Strikeships, the same kind of ship used by the War Fleet

&amp;#x200B;

And defending the Empire's Home System and Capital is the Praetorian Fleet consisting of 8000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

The Military only uses one type of ship which is the Legion Class Strikeship which is based from the designs of the Imperius Class Battleships, the ancient ships that escorted the many Crescendian Worldships as they were finding a new home, unlike other Galactic Powers like the Kahlesia Empire (my version of the Klingons) or the UFS (my version of the Federation) which possesses mulitple ship classes, the Legion Class has been used by the Empire for Centuries and has remained as thier main Workhorse, winning Multiple wars, they are very heavily Shielded and Armored and Armed and is about the length of a Galaxy Class and Firepower that rivals both the Prometheus Class or Defiant Class and the Triumph Card of the Legion Class is their Shields and weapons are undetectable and leaves behind no energy traces and is also unadaptable by Groll Technology (my version of the Borg)

&amp;#x200B;

Strikeship Specs

Crew = 4600

Propulsion = 4 Gravity Impulse Drives, 2 Class 9 warp cores

Weapons = 8 Dimensional Wave Strips, 4 Frontal Torpedo and 2 back Torpedo

Defense = Double Layer Unimatrix Shield Grid, 20 Meter Heavy Composite Allow Composition Armor

Weakness = very slow combat speed and turning rate

&amp;#x200B;

============

Technology

============

The Crescendians posses Advanced Technologies that rivals the UFS or the Kahlesia or the Dominion, they posses Advanced Replicator Facilities that are able to recreate none Crescendian Technology with ease, and they were able to Replicate a Hermes Class Explorer (JJprise USS Kelvin) molecules to molecules, wires by wires, Everything, all within just a Hour

&amp;#x200B;

The most greatest Technological Advancements they achieved is Mega Colossal Stellar Engineering, they were able to build Crest, the Capital World, within JUST a Year and improved thier Technology and go on to build multiple Artificial Worlds WITHIN MONTHS across the Crescsius Empire  while it took a massive Combined Collaboration of the UFS and the Kahlesia Empire and 4 other Major Galactic Powers, 50 YEARS to build Starbase Unity (my version of Starbase Yorktown). Not even the Groll or Dominion can do such advanced feats

&amp;#x200B;

======================

Crescsius Empire Capital

====================

""Crest""

The Crescendian Capital, a massive Artificial Construct that is far bigger (larger then Starbase Yorktown, ST Beyond) then Earth and it's the Center of Crescendian Power and Sovereignty

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Population Size

There's an Estimated 360,000,000,000 Souls living in Crest, which is 40 Percent of the Entire Crescendian Species

&amp;#x200B;

The population is more the UFS's Starbase Unity

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Infarstructure

the Center of the Construct is a Singularity Neutron Power Core that powers the entire Homeworld, the Construct contains a Artificial Atmosphere Regulated by 6 Atmospheric Towers and Lush Gardens and Fields across the surface and many Business and Cooperate Cities and a Exposed Naval Pier covered only by a Colossal Blast Door which houses 8000 ships, the Praetorian Fleet protecting Crest, while beneath the Surface houses the Vast Population Hubs and Recreation Centers and deeper nearer the Core houses the vast Replicator Factories and Assembly Plants and Laboratories and also contains a Massive Naval Pier that houses 15 000 ships, the Crescendian War Fleet and Vast Barracks and Training Centers for Soldiers and at the very center is the Power Core

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Planetary Defenses

Guarding Crest is a Network of Heavily Armed Satellites that protect Crest, followed by a Outer Planetary Shield that covers the entire Capital World and is controlled by 6 Orbital Shield Generators with only a single entrance guarded by a Heavily Armed Fortress that acts as Custom Control for ships in and out of the Capital while acting as a Civilian Shipyard and Trading Center and contains mulitple Shopping Centers and Hotels

&amp;#x200B;

Within Crest itself the Artificial World is also protected by a Planetary Sheild that is cushioned right above the Magnetic Sphere that keeps the Atmosphere of Crest breathable, space between the Shield and the Outer Planetary Shield is quite far, which is far enough that many Youngsters like to fly to that area and recreate famous dogfights, a constant nuisance for the Police, besides the Shields, the entire Surface contains a massive Network of Guns that can fire Repulsor Beams to ward away ships or Gravitational Beams to Vaporise entire Fleets, one gun is enough to destroy a Fully Shielded Fully Tactical Modified Galaxy Class in one Shot at low power and the Artificial World posses a Total of 100 000 spread across the Surface

&amp;#x200B;

A massive fleet of 8000 Warships defends the Artificial World and the Crescia System from Intruders or Invaders

&amp;#x200B;

Combining all of it's Defenses makes Crest arguably the most Heavily Fortified and Heavily Defended and Heavily Populated World in all of the Milky Way

&amp;#x200B;

The Defense Satellites are nested in-between the Outer Planetary Shield and Inner Planetary Shield

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Crest is very Similar to Coruscant from Star Wars the only difference is Coruscant is originally a Planet but Crest is entirely Artificial, there's little to no Green Grass spots in Coruscant but there's large Continent sized Grass Lands and Forests on Crest

&amp;#x200B;

Another difference is Coruscant is a City Planet, completely covered by cities and no empty lands, while Crest is only 40% covered by Cities

&amp;#x200B;

The only Artificial Object of similar strength is Starbase Unity which is also guarded by a Network of Satellites and Surface Guns

Which TV shows about Artificial Intelligence have had the biggest influence on you?,"(I’m a new/inexperienced redditor, apologies if this is inappropriate/incorrect)
I’m a screenwriter/director, and I I tend to write stories involving AI. I was recently re-watching some of my favorite television shows about artificial intelligence, and I was surprised by how many ideas and concepts I’d subconsciously absorbed as part of my own AI mythology. I’d love to hear more about which shows people love and why. Here are mine:

1. Westworld - This is the most thoughtful series out right now addressing AI ethics and philosophy, and represents Crichton’s ideology that life always finds a way with Nolan’s ongoing interest in philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and memory.  
2. Person of Interest - The philosophical arguments about the AI Alignment problem are delicious, the ideas around the weaponization of AI are thoughtful, and the overall theme of existential risk from artificial general intelligence but for a general audience (On CBS!) was just amazing.
3. Caprica - I’m just finishing up this rewatch now, and loving the discussions about Philosophy of mind, and the difference between a human mind, an Avatar, and a digital self. 
4. Battlestar Galactica - And of course in BSG we see the ultimate result of the decisions made in Caprica, and what the outcome was for humans. 
5. Dollhouse - While this show doesn’t explicitly discuss AI, that’s essential what is happening - and the idea of people being loaded with new skills and personalities is matrix-like as well as something that we see in an explicitly AI context in Westworld
6. Jem and the Holograms - This was my earliest memory of an impactful and relatable AI in the form of Synergy, and she was from an era of kind and empathetic AIs and is more in the form of Nick Bostrom’s “Oracle” friendly AI, as she rarely took action, and manifested and altered reality in the form of local holograms projected from a pair of earrings. 
7. Max Headroom - More of the Dollhouse/Caprica AI ideas of downloading a person’s neurological data to re-create their personality as an AI. 
8. Altered Carbon - The hotel AI here is a wonderful representation of a thoughtful building in a pantheon of AIs that have little more than disdain for the humans that they now exploit. 
9. Knight Rider - A limited friendly AI, much like Synergy, but one that had a strong impact on me as a kid and created positive feelings for artificial life forms. 

I’m aware of the show Humans, but it didn’t capture my interest yet. Are there any other TV shows specifically that have AI as a major character or theme?  I know that Red Dwarf and Star Trek have AIs, but I feel that AI wasn’t a primary character or theme like it is in the above shows. 

I’d love your thoughts and recommendations. ","Which TV shows about Artificial Intelligence have had the biggest influence on you? (I’m a new/inexperienced redditor, apologies if this is inappropriate/incorrect)

Heinlein's Tunnel in the Sky (spoilers),"A group of high school students are sent to a wild planet for an ""Advanced Survival Class"" where they're supposed to survive for two weeks. They are told several times to beware of the ""stobor"". This word is supposed to be a stand-in for any dangerous creature, but in my high school brain, I spotted ""robots"" spelled backwards. For 90% of the story I mistakenly believed that the jump gate wasn't lost, but the kids were in an extended simulation where they were being observed by robots. Forty years later it still makes me chuckle. Great book, you should read it. I haven't had the patience to reread any of Heinlein's longer works, but the juveniles are great.

Looking for a story about massively increased intelligence and murder,"Inspired by this sub's ability to get [u/jcsensational](https://www.reddit.com/user/jcsensational) the story he was looking for, I have to give a try for one that has been driving me crazy for years.  I THINK I read it in Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine or Analogue, but it could have been from an anthology.

&amp;#x200B;

The story is about lab subjects given massively increased intelligence ala Flowers for Algernon.  The main character escapes the lab.  A fractured bit of scene I recall is that he spoofs a login or lock screen by building up a counterfeit screen from assembly language, gains someone's credentials and effects his escape.  He goes on to acquire a bunch of wealth on the outside.  Another slice of remembered scene is him installing positive feedback loops within the CEOs of companies he invests in just by having casual conversation with them.  He eventually notices perturbances in the stock market that could only be created by someone with intelligence equal to his own, with this other party using the market as a whole to send a message to him.  Someone else has escaped the lab.

&amp;#x200B;

The two titans meet, and have a deeply productive conversation as one has used his abilities to study the human condition, while the other has focused on study of the external world.  As I recall, they then go about trying to murder one another, with one eventually winning by imprinting a pattern on a tee shirt that, upon seeing it, leads the other into an inescapable mental loop (shades of Infinite Jest or Snow Crash, but I am pretty sure this story precedes both).  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have been trying to hunt down this story for years, but my Googlefu has always proven inadequate.  Let's see if crowd-sourcing works!  This ringing any bells?  It obviously made quite an impression as the perfect adolescent power fantasy for me.  I would love to know who wrote it to explore more of their work.

"In many science fiction stories, the existence of God is denied. Could we call science fiction as an atheist literary genre?","In science fiction literature, many stories take place either on a fictional rendition of Earth or involve protagonists who either lived on Earth at some point or who have ancestors who lived on Earth. In our real world, the entire global population is slowly trending toward atheism or at least nonreligious affiliation, except perhaps for Islam, which is actually expanding. Nonetheless, if the trend toward atheism and other nonreligious affiliation persists, then even Islam’s growth can be expected to halt and recede.

Since most science fiction stories take place in a universe where some version of real-world Earth existed, we can expect the dismissal of God (or any god for that matter) to be widespread within those stories, especially if the story in question is so far in the future that something like interstellar travel is routine (still impossible with our current technology and no signs of becoming possible in any foreseeable future).

Moreover, even though the stories that authors tell are clearly fictional, the god claim is apparently way too fictional even for them. That is fair: it is clearly evidence that God does not exist in our real world and therefore would not exist in any imagination of a future based on our real world.","In many science fiction stories, the existence of God is denied.

Seeking 1980's Sci-Fi short story collection with entry about a praying mantis from her perspective,"I read this story back in the mid-90's, so this is all from 20+ year old memories.

The sci-fi collection book had a red cover with a large breasted alien/robot. Or maybe the alien was red but the cover was not.

The praying mantis story was called something like ""A Day in the Life of Tsang Jueng"" and was from the perspective of the praying mantis. She hunted and interacted with her environment. At one point she meets a spider and the differing hunting methods, net vs ambush, is discussed. She kills and eats a caterpillar.

Help choosing next book,"Hi, this is my first post in this sub.
I just finished a book I was reading and I want to read some scifi novel next (preferably spanning several books).

changing the past for a better future?,"I see a lot of scifi with backwards time travel play with the idea of changing history. Mostly exploring how to avoid paradoxes, or to ensure that everything remain exactly the same, or sometimes with characters individually choosing to live in the past for some personal preference with the understanding that nothing will really change because of that.

But I am looking for a different angle. Does anyone know of any work that explores the idea that changing the status quo might actually be beneficial in both the past and with future developments? Like a good ""let's kill hitler"" story where the lesson isn't ""well all those people needed to die otherwise our dystopian state would end up even worse than it already is!"". But more an exploration of a timeline where leftists won the culture war post world war 1 in germany. Or to prevent the genocide of native americans, and what it might be like if colonists lived in peace and adopted non hierarchal values instead of trying to own and control the natives. Or an exploration of what it would be like if aristocratic values died  before capitalism could be established as a valid school of thought, and how that would result in expanding democracy and social consciousness in general. 

It all feels very ""The status quo is what we know, it's safe. Anything different than we have now must fundamentally be worse. The system sucks, but it could be worse, so I guess it's fine."" which I find a bit unfulfilling and non challenging of conservative ideology, as well as lacking in historical context. Which I find odd, since the scifi genre is typically full of leftist influence, especially when there's space exploration or colonization involved. Not to mention all about exploring hypotheticals and sometimes even alternative universes.

But I also feel like I must have missed something because it makes no sense for those themes to have never been explored before in relation to traveling back in time.","changing the past for a better future?

"I arranged Song Of Durin (Lord Of The Rings) for 13 Cellos, here is the result ! (100+ hours of work)","Video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo)

&amp;#x200B;

I am in love with Tolkien World, Lord of the Rings books, films, &amp; soundtrack.

Song Of Durin was composed by Clamavi de Profundis, an awesome singer band doing Cover &amp; Original composition around Tolkien Universe. I am a huge fan of the original music, so I decided to make the Cello Cover for 13 Cellos.

This music fits perfectly with the deep warm &amp; mysterious sound of the Cello. There are 7 differents parts, all played twice except the Melody (in the big central screen).

2 Cellos are doing the lower bass (on the down side corner), holding a single deep note : Bb on the C string (I use a scordatura = detune the cello to gain access to lower note than on a normal cello)

2 Cellos are doing the upper bass (on the left side)

2 Cellos are doing the tenor (on the right side)

4 Cellos are doing the alto (on the top side, split into 2)

And finally, 2 cellos are doing drums, I had to remix &amp; change a lot the sound to make the sound better :)

A huge thanks to Clamavi De Profundis for creating this awesome music &amp; for sharing for free the sheet music (available in description)

Thanks everyone, hope you enjoyed this one !﻿","I arranged Song Of Durin (Lord Of The Rings) for 13 Cellos, here is the result ! (100+ hours of work) Video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo)

Struggled through 'Consider Phlebas'. Loving 'Excession'. Will I like……?,"My friend lent me a pile of books from the Culture series, minus ‘The Player of Games’ and ‘Use of Weapons’. I started with 'Consider Phlebas', expecting to love it having read a number of Bank’s fiction works and having enjoyed those (especially 'The Wasp Factory').  

Sadly I found CP a chore. It just seemed to drag for me and was too long-winded. It redeemed itself somewhat by the time it got to chapter 9, Schar’s World. I enjoyed the last third of the book more than the previous two thirds.  

Even so, at that point I was still considering whether to read another. However, I am glad I did. I have started on 'Excession' and I am loving it. Lots of interesting ideas; more insight into the Culture; the different personalities of the AI ships; more intrigue and suspense.  

Part of the problem with CP, for me, is that you very quickly discover what the story is about. Let’s all go to Schar’s World. Excession has more mystery and suspense.  

Given that I am loving 'Excession' do you think that I would like **‘The Player of Games’** and **‘Use of Weapons’**, as I am considering buying them? Thanks.","Struggled through 'Consider Phlebas'.

Opinions on Cory Doctrow?,"My science fiction reading for a while has veered towards the more earth bound than space bound.  Even as a kid I was never a huge 'space sci fi' reader.  Large battles never really appealed to me, there are some exceptions, I read what I consider the definitive Star Wars 7/8/9 trilogy by Timothy Zahn.  I get that it's not the 'canon' trilogy but after a double feature of The Last Jedi and Solo when I was laid up in bed recently, I am comfortable saying that no matter how good number 9 is - the Zahn trilogy is still better at least to me.

As a kid I was more a fantasy reader I think, I started getting into sci fi I think in grad school (94-97) with Neuromancer, than Snow Crash, but as I got older I have veered more towards the 'near future stuff'.  I loved the truth machine for instance, and daniel suarez.  I think the Nexus series is amazing and wish Infomacracy wasn't ending.

So, that's my 'point of view', but I also very much like Cory Doctrow's take on things. The brother books, for the wind, makers, those are the ones I've primarily read, but I know he has a broader base of fiction and non fiction and I'm wondering what other people think of him.  Does anyone else like his stuff?

Alastair Reynolds world-(book?)weariness,"So I’ve read most of the fiction in AR’s Revelation Space Universe, I’d finished it all (with the exception of a couple novellas) around Autumn of last year. I’ve recently decided to re-read my way through it. The gothic space opera melded with hard science fiction was an absolute game-changer the first time round.

However, is anyone else struggling to plough through a second read with the knowledge of what happens at the end of his books? Without invoking the spoiler gods, is anyone else having/had this problem? Is there any way around this? 

Also, if anyone dear god has any authors more or less on a similar vein to the darkness/cynicism/hope of AL’s Revelation Space Universe could you plz recommend.

[SPS] Continuum Force | Chapter 6 | Pax Romana Pt III,"**Episode Summary**

In this mid-season finale, key members of the team are disappearing from time and Rome has seized control of the base, the remaining Continuum Force make one last ditch effort to save the timeline and restore things as they should be.

**Show Summary**

An elite force of time travelers discover a terrible truth. The chronicles we’ve known may not be our past, it could have been altered, our memories changed and history itself set on a different path. They investigate these anomalies, traveling to different periods of our ancient past to stop the malevolent enemy trying to write a new chapter in humanity’s story. They are our only defense, heroes of ages ago, today, and the Future. They are…the Continuum Force.

Book description: 

Who is the Mystery Girl?

Bernard Abbey’s life was routine, stagnant, and lonely. That all changed the day she entered his life. To save him from being killed, a mysterious young woman transports Bernard to another point in time. As he comes to grips with what has happened, Bernard realizes his new friend is unable to speak. She cannot tell him who she is, where she came from, or how she can travel through time. Even worse, she’s unable to tell him what is chasing her.

As she takes him back and forth in time, they cross paths with strangers who claim to know his new friend, each with a different story of her origin. The only thing he knows for certain is that the fate of humanity’s idyllic future is somehow connected with his new companion.

“Sanderson blew my temporally-frazzled mind multiple times as the battle ranged from past to present ... and even in-between.” - William F. Aicher - Author of 'The Unfortunate Expiration of Mr. David S. Sparks'

BSG is so disappointing...,"*Spoilers and rant warning*

I'm rewatching B5 right now and being blown away by how well executed everything is plot wise. (Obviously some stuff got rushed at the end of season 4 because the show was about to be canceled only to leave season 5 kind of hollow outside of the centauri plot). 

My point is I remeber being blown away by the BSG miniseries and season 1. The show did a great job of creating a gritty realistic (for a sci fi show in space) scenario in which you truly believed that Galactica had no chance of being successful in saving the remaining human race. Season 2 was pretty good as well, and I was willing to accept the religious prophecies as the seemed to be the only way Galactic had any chance of beating this unstoppable cylon force. 

Then they get stranded on new caprica and it becomes very obvious the show has no clue what it's doing. The ""all of a sudden we don't want to kill you"" Cylon thing completely destroyed the shows amazing tone and from there everything that happened was complete bullshit. The contrast between 33 and the finale where Galactica singlehandedly genocides the Cylons is laughable. 

Sorry for the rant the only reason I brought up B5 is because you can see how JMS had a plan the whole time, where as BSG falls flat on its face once you realize they had no clue how to end it. Little things like the fact the final 5 was not conceived until midway through season 3 really kills the show, and makes the last 2 seasons a real waste.

YEARS ago I wrote something I titled Metro-12, which was about a futuristic society in which supercities had grown up, named Metro-1, 2, 3, etc. and Metro-12 had fallen to a bio disaster that rendered the city cut off from the outside world, surrounded by a poisonous/toxic cloud of biomatter called ""flack,"" and the city itself broken down and filled with mutated humans/zombies and a handful of survivors. Hiro, our MC, has been sent in with AIMEE, the AI of his awesome advanced motorcycle, to investigate and search for someone special.

I abandoned it for some reason, but I found it again and have about 17k words written.

"What are some good ""entry-level"" scifi/scifi for non-scifi-nerds? Specific audiobooks with high quality and relatively easy listening?","Gonna be taking a long roadtrip with my GF in a couple months, and we'll probably grab an audiobook to listen to.

It's for my birthday, so I persuaded her to let me pick the book ;) She even said she might be more open to a scifi book if it's an audiobook, because listening would probably be better than reading.

I'm a longtime fan of the genre and have immersed myself in a lot of hyper-complex worlds (Stephenson novels, currently reading the Night's Dawn trilogy). These are the type of books I want to avoid, as they can even be challenging for me to maintain interest in due to complexity and length.

One of my favorite books ever is Hyperion, which is an *amazing* audiobook as well. Unfortunately I don't think I can consume it again as I've read/listened to it like 4 times, but the prose and storytelling in that book really lends itself to the audiobook format, and I would guess it would be pretty appealing to a non-fan of the genre.

So, what are your recommendations? Something that isn't too heavy on the hard sci-fi/confusing abstractions, but still a great example of the genre. Something that tells a gripping/entertaining story that can appeal to a wide variety of audiences.

Potential examples from books I've read - 

The City and the City + Perdido Street Station - China Mieville

Broken Earth Trilogy - NK Jemisin

The Name of the Wind/Wise Man's Fear - Patrick Rothfuss

GoT - Main man George

...in short - action and suspense alongside interesting but not overwrought speculative fiction.

EDIT: to clarify from the title, anything fitting in SciFi, Fantasy, or SpecFic is fair game.

Speculation regarding far future concepts,"Recently I've come up with a couple concepts for future technologies, and I would like to run them by you fine fellows to get your take. A lot of these ideas are simply new applications of already existing concepts, so naturally I'm not claiming to have come up with literally everything here. 

I would greatly appreciate it if you could point out any potential flaws in these concepts, as this stuff is quite out there.

&amp;#x200B;

# Quad Kugelblitz/Pion rocket hybrid

The obvious question here is ""what's the benefit to combining these two different methods of interstellar travel?"". My idea is that if you create a ring of rotating kugelblitz's^(1)  the ergosphere^(2)  of each black hole will be amplified towards the center of the array. The advantage of this is if you funnel your proton/anti-proton reaction into this region and induce some of the pions to fall into the closest kugelblitz, the remaining pions would accelerate further via the penrose process^(3). Furthermore, if you channeled the pions predominantly towards a specific black hole, the rotation of that particular kugelblitz would slow faster than the rest, essentially turning it into a massive reaction wheel. The pion stream emerging from the rear of the craft would also be gravitationally effected in such a way that would further compliment this result. 

Furthermore, a percentage of the gamma rays produced in the proton annihilation could fall into a kugelblitz and potentially begin super radiant scattering^(4). Perhaps you could accomplish this by having a meta-stable sphere of nuclear pasta^(5) suspended around each kugelblitz. The gamma rays would scatter in the gap in between the pasta and the kugelblitz. Pasta has certain phases, so my idea is that as the mass of the kugelblitz reduces due to hawking radiation the pasta would reverse phase back towards gnocchi, allowing some gamma to leave as well as more radiation and particles to fall in. The mass would increase, closing to pasta and allowing the gamma to once again begin scattering. the process would reciprocate in a form of pulsed propulsion. I have absolutely no idea if the pasta would actually behave like this, and was hoping someone could enlighten me. Even if it doesn't, this engine could function without the pasta.

Just a side tangent here, but would a naked singularity^(6) have advantages over conventional black holes? They'd probably put out more energy, but Idk.

# Unbihexium radiation shielding

Since atoms with high atomic mass are more effective at shielding radiation, it only seems natural that elements an the mythical island of stability^(7) would be effective at shielding the high levels of radiation incurred by interstellar travel. Of course this is heavily dependent on how stable these elements actually are, as well as how well they react to being bombarded during transit. 

I was inspired by [this](https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0610/0610030.pdf) paper about how radiation shielding could work. The front of the ship could have a heavy unbihexium shield,  as well as a halbach array to help shield from the magnetized component of the interstellar medium. The halbach array would also prevent the field from permeating the ship and interfering with electronics.

# G-force mitigation

As you may well know G-forces are a massive limitation to how fast you can travel. Most ships would be limited to staying close to 1 G most of the time. But what if you genetically engineered in a few extra organs to prevent blood from sloshing around? Furthermore, what if you filled cavities with fluids such as perfluorocarbons^(7)  and placed them under high pressures to prevent the fluids from rupturing organs? If this would be an effective method to raising G-Force tolerance, by how much? Could it be enough to be able to more practically launch people into space with a rail gun? Very compelling questions indeed.

# Ftl particle transmission via quantum tunneling  

This last one is more of a direct question that a concept. According to [this](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.708) paper quantum tunneling is superluminal process. Since a particle's DeBroglie wavelength encompasses the entire universe, if you could induce long distance tunneling wouldn't you be able you communicate superluminally?

Quantum entanglement has been proposed by some as a method to accomplish this (such as in *Singularity Sky* by Charles  Stross), but I think the consensus is that manipulating the particles in order to communicate would collapse the wave function and render this impossible. So it strikes me as odd that tunneling could accomplish this. It would be cool if it could though.

^(1) A black hole made of light.

^(2) A region of space-time that rotates due to the high angular momentum of a black hole. 

^(3) A process where the angular momentum of a black hole is tapped into by exchanging mass energy.

^(4) A process by which radiation becomes energized due to the angular momentum of a black hole.

^(5) Essentially the crust of a neutron star. It's hypothetically 10 billion times stronger than steel.

^(6) A naked singularity is a black hole who's ergosphere dips below the event horizon.

Could you build a shell from material on Earth around the sun?,"So, I wanted to make a couple specifications. Obviously this would be some sort of crazy material, but whatever, scifi! Also, prepare for arbitrary numbers.

* **Non-habitable**
* **1nm - 10mm thick** (originally I said 0.75mm but hey, it's sci-fi, let's have some fun!)
* **Less than 0.5 AU from the Sun**
* **Uses panels for said sphere** instead of one uniform shell; example, a 1m x 1m panel of matter 0.75mm - 10mm thick
* **Gaps between shell panels** \- I don't have a particular number, but for example: *gap of 1 meter - 1 kilometer*.
* **Material does not have to be useful or durable** (but if it can be, that'd be awesome)
* **Material must be a solid**
* **Density can range from approaching nothing to massively dense**

So, would there be enough?

Edit: This is even more ridiculous, but it'd be funny to add: 1nm thickness.

Edit: Not sure why the downvotes but hey, at least we have an answer. :)

"Looking for Story, maybe George O Smith","The story involves (a) learning a language with a vast set of phonemes and which greatly increases your intelligence. Maybe also (b) a body transformation which keeps you at an ideal weight. But I've possibly conflated those two.

I bought an ebook with some stories by George O. Smith on the basis that it had Highways In Hiding, which I connected to my searched for target. But it didn't. HIH had to do with a body transformation which could be fatal or miraculous. But there was no linguistic component nor was there an intelligence aspect.

In the same book was a story (The Fourth R) which proposed a machine which could help you memorize knowledge which then became part of your toolkit for future intellectual discovery.

But the two aspects I recall were:

First, an artificial language had been created with a multitude of phonemes, so that a huge number of words could be very short. This led to faster speech and even thinking. The ability to learn this language was an indication that you had the ability to take advantage of it.

Second, a body transformation, possibly similar to that of HIH. But the scene I recall had a woman, who had been offered the change, said that if it meant that she could eat as much as she wanted without gaining weight, she was all for it. Even as a kid in the 60s, I saw this as sexist.

The problem with HIH is that it didn't deal with weight gain. The problem with TFR is that there wasn't the implication of greater intelligence, just greater knowledge, although many may conjoin those two.","Looking for Story, maybe George O Smith The story involves (a) learning a language with a vast set of phonemes and which greatly increases your intelligence.

"I arranged Misty Mountains Cold (The Hobbit soundtrack) for my Cello, here is the result ! (30+ hours work)","Here is my new Cello Cover !

I am in love with Tolkien World, Lord of the Rings books, films, &amp; soundtrack. All the music from Howard Shore is absolutely beautiful &amp; I decided to arranged this song for Cello Solo.

The originally baryton singer fits perfectly with Cello Tune, &amp; the cello makes it even more sad &amp; nostalgic. I used a lot of double strings (= playing 2 strings at the same time) to make the illusion of 2 cellos playing, first one doing the theme, the second one accompanying.

I also use left hand pizzicato (3:27), while playing with bow.

This is an amateur work, but totally passionate :)

Subject: The Physics of Sci Fi Shields,"I'm posting this for a friend whose PC fried, but he'd like to get some responses sooner than later. So, I hope this is the spot to ask.

Is there a scientific basis for the type of shields depicted on sci fi shows? In a nutshell, how would such a device actually function, theoretically speaking, against the various types of threats. energy weapons, plasma, missles, projectiles, etc

How much energy would be be looking at to project that kind of a field around a ship? My assumption is that it's beyond the amount of power generation we have available, but that's just a guess.

[Self-Promo Saturday] Patient 3,"Patient 3

I wrote a book with a new take on the alien invasion genre, check it :)

In the near future, a mysterious neurological disorder infects one in fifty thousand people and spreads when the host is conscious and active. Cerebral Nervorum quickly leads to the degradation of the individual’s motor functions and memory until an inevitable death finds them days later. Unable to afford gene editing therapy to tame this disease, Michael elects to take the route of being placed into a medically induced coma with the support of his fiancée Eve. This is the common treatment option for the lower and middle class of society to cope until a cure is developed and viable for the general population.

Several years later, Michael and five other patients awaken to a world where an alien force has nearly wiped out the inhabitants of Earth and flattened its cities. The group faces a deadly game of cat and mouse from these beings and simultaneously a race against the clock from the fatal disease that is eating away at their minds and bodies. Michael and the patients learn there is an underground sanctuary where survivors are gathering a few miles away. What keeps Michael going is an audio journal Eve left for him during his hospital stay. It allows him to hear his love’s voice and gives glimpses of the past and events leading up to the invasion as he traverses the wasteland of the city in search of the human encampment.

[sps] Synaptica: Connections,"**Connections**


In the academy we have a saying. Everything connected.

It means exactly what it sounds like. Mathematical functions, quantum strings, chemical bonds, nucleotide pairs…all the universe defined and interdependent upon all the rest of the universe. But to the Synaptica there is one connection of paramount importance. And that is the neuron. For if you can manipulate the neuron you can control the fate of man. 

The woman hung from the radio tower, naked and upside down, legs nailed together as if she were JC superstar, platinum blonde hair streaked with blood and flapping across her face like a plastic bag in a storm. 

“We found her like this,” the patrolman announces “about an hour ago, neighbor who lives in the high rise across the way called it in. Said it looked like someone was trying to climb the antenna. Then when we got here we found her...like that.”

“And the android?” I ask.

The patrolman motions towards the rooftop ledge. I follow, stepping gingerly over the police tape, shoes crunching on the frosty gravel as we approach the figure tucked against the parapet wall. The light from my subdermal implant cutting through the midnight gloom until it falls upon this pretzeled man, still leaking antifreeze from his head. iHuman assistant, 2063 model. Dressed in a slim-fit charcoal suit with a black tie and cotton white shirt. Freshly groomed shave job and immaculately clean fingernails. Perfect gentleman were it not for his limbs, snapped in half and bent backwards as if he had suddenly metamorphosed into some giant dead insect. Heels folded onto his spine, head buried in his own contorted hands. Madonna wept.

“Why do they do that?” The patrolman questions keeping his distance.

“Do what?”

“Bend like that?”

“Decerebrate posturing. Indicates terminal circuit damage. Everything above the red nucleus must be fried. Did you move him?”

“No. No one has touched a thing.”

I crouch over the machine. Taking a fountain pen out from my coat pocket and with it sliding a hand from the robot’s face, revealing two empty sockets where eyes used to be, now crusting over with aquamarine gel. 

“Shit.” the patrolman exclaims. “Clawed his fucking eyes out. Why would he, why would he do that?”

I stand up, canvasing the rooftop. Pillars of steam rise from chimney pipes. Whirling air conditioners. Tetris ductwork pinging like only heated metal can. 

“Why would an android do any of this?” I counter, pacing back to the woman and trying to gauge how high off the ground she really was. Then from behind me comes another voice, deeper and rough, like gargled sand in tonic water.

“Who the fuck is this?” 

I turn to see this police officer emerging from the rooftop accessway and marching past the taped off perimeter. He is big, grizzled and raw, like a shark out of water. Some dried up genealogy with nothing else to lose. Black combat fatigues, ex-military then. Hair beginning to edge grey but the pumped iron biceps of someone half his age. Cigarette pinched between the whirling articulation of his prosthetic arm until he flicks the bud casually over the ledge.

“Is anyone going to answer me?” He barks getting closer. “You guys let someone else onto my crime scene, no one thought to ask me. Last time I checked I run mech Ops. That still correct?”

“Synaptic.” Patrolman whispers.

“What?”

“She is Synaptic. Federal agent.”

There is silence on the rooftop as the detective chews this over. My eyes are still glued up on our victim however, trying to piece together just how the android got her all the way up the antenna. I rest my hand on the scaffolding while the detective attempts to compose himself. The metal is as cold as November.

“Ahem.” The officer coughs with every ounce of his self restraint. Out the corner of my eye I can see him extending his gauntlet at me. 

“Mitch Connors. District Investigator. Mechanical Operations.”

“Cerpin Vex.” I say barely acknowledging him. Hoisting myself up onto the antenna instead and climbing hand over hand up the metal lattice towards my down-on-her-luck Rapunzel. 

“They, uh, sent you down here to…”

“You ever see a case like this?” I ask.

“A case like this, no. I can’t say that I…”

“A malfunction.”

Mitch crosses his arm, looking back and forth from the enucleated android to the femme fatale. 

“Android malfunction? Shit many times. Back when I was a cadet this was all we’d get. 10-16’s like night and day.” He fakes a bad impression of a lil-ol-lady.”’My robot is trying to kill me!’ But that was before they had quite figured out the logic algorithms. There hasn’t been a case like this in…”

“Eighteen years. May 3rd, 2119. Outside Detroit. That was the last confirmed malfunction.”

“Yeah,” Mitch perplexed but mostly uninterested “...if you say so.”

Still climbing I reach the woman. Extend my arm to grab her skull. Digging my fingernails hard into her scalp I look for for ghosts. 

This is getting painfully basic but for the sake of having everyone on the same page, we will start at the beginning. A neuron is an excitable cell, in the same way as an electrocution chamber. Neurons are microscopic units of life with only one purpose, to carry an electrical signal from one point in space to another. Occasionally, these little bastards will modify the strength or the frequency of the signal. But they don’t think. They don’t communicate with the beyond. They just transmit. 

And underneath my fingernails are the receivers. SQUIDS. Superconducting quantum interface devices. Sensitive enough to detect and decode the cacophony of magneto-encephalographic waves emitted by a human brain. The first of many psycho-surgical “gifts” implanted into a young Synaptic. A tool allowing us, for lack of a better phrase, to read minds. 

Normally this would allow me to crack the woman's mind. Even freshly expired brains could be momentarily jump-started for one encor clue. But it doesn’t take me long to realize that this time no one’s home. She’s likely been dead for hours. I pull my hand away, brushing off flecks of that blue gel when something else catches my attention and I lean in. A small copper necklace dangling around her engorged throat, with an inverted cross at the end. I snap the cross from her neck and begin my descent back to the rooftop. 

“Can I get you an evidence bag for that?” Mitch calls up. “Maybe follow some fucking crime scene protocols.” I ignore him as I climb back down. 

As I drop the last few feet to the ground, Mitch, who has been inspecting the other android, stands up. 

“The eyes are kinda weird. I mean he clawed out her eyes, strung her up there and then took out his own?

“No.” I tell him, picking residual coolant from my fingernails “He did his eyes first. She still has his blue fluid stuck in her hair.”

“So he hauled her up there and nailed her in completely blind?”

“Would appear so.”

I stop at the rooftop access, an itch on the back of my mind screaming that the calculation was in error. Turn back to the crime scene, the woman, the android, the trillion chromatic lights of the city beyond. 

“Get the vic's body down” I order “and packaged off to forensics. The android as well.”

Then I am gone, descending the condominium stairwell. Trying to ignore the water damage trickling down the cinderblock wall or the misaligned checkerboard tiling. This is what always happened when a Synaptic was activated. One by one the implants start to wake up. Rolling over, taking over until you, the person you were, was just a memory along for the ride. Piggy backing on a philosophical zombie in an OCD search for answers. 

This right here, that new found uncanny attention to detail, that was my Abacampus. Tucked neatly beside my thalamus, this cybernetic implant was an voracious consumer of input. Picking out every minute detail from my sensorium. Scribbling them across my cortex in indelibly red ink. 

I am halfway down this rabbit hole when the detective bursts through the doorway two stories above. 

“What the fuck do you think your doing?” Mitch yells at me over the banister railing.

“My job, Detective Connors.”

“This is my precinct,” he shouts, taking stairs two at a time  “android malfunction falls under mech Ops jurisdiction. Why is pre-crime even involved here...she’s...she is dead already!”

“Detective Connors, do you know how many iHuman units there are in this city?”

“No but…”

“No one does. That’s how ubiquitous they are. And since the company that manufactured them went bankrupt there is no central registrar available to track them all down. Makes mass recall all but impossible. Which means that if these machines are capable of killing again it’ is a big fucking deal.”

My feet slide to halt and I round on the detective. “Which is why they sent me. Now I am sorry if you feel my department is stepping on toes but that's how it is sweetheart. Don't like it, you can piss off. Or you can tag along, watching, while the professionals stop a goddamn catastrophe.” I resume marching down the stairs but Connors has not had enough. He follows me. 

“That’s all well and good, Ms. whatever-your-name-was. But I’ve run this beat since you were sucking thumbs, with a damn fine track records and...hold your fucking panties, I ain’t done with you…”

He grabs my jacket and I snap. Jackknifing the palm of my hand up towards his nose. Aimed such that the nasal bones will be fragment into his frontal cortex. An instantly lethal blow. At the last second my sympathies intervene and I curl my fingers instead into a fist. My punch knocks him to the cinderblock wall, but does not kill him. He slumps against the floor clutching at his now broken nose as I step over him.

“Detective Connors, do not ever touch me again. I am heading to the station. You can meet me in forensics if you want to be there when we open the can. Or not.” Then I resume walking down the stairs.

My interceptor is waiting for me in the garage. I saddle into the vehicle and program coordinates for SFPD. M-foils unfolding as the grav-car lifts away from the parking slot and makes its way out of the skyrise garage. Fliting out into the night to join the technicolor of downtown air traffic. Through the windshield, virtual rails guide my ride on collision rendezvous with our destination. I can see raindrops beginning to dot the glass. 

The city spreads out below me like an underpaid call girl, beautiful yet venereal. My car weaves through what was left of the sky, artificial canyons rising on all sides, ever higher as I enter into the Nexus proper. Towering corporate structures merging one on top of the other until it is all just concrete tesseract. Size and perspective being luxuries one can’t afford when you are this rich. Around me dance the real denizens of this place, holographic advertisements and commercialized paraphernalia. Blink and the neon billboard in front of you has morphed into a styrofoam cup of joe. Marketing algorithms reading your mind almost as well as a Synaptica could. I really could go for a cup of coffee. 

The brain, that was where we left off. Your precious, unique, incomprehensible brain. Seated at the right hand of the almighty and just left of an ear. It brings me no joy to confess this but this organ, for all intents and purposes, is an overrated computer. Here is how it works. Afferent neurons carry sensory input from the universe. This information is processed through a complex web of interneurons. Then efferent neurons issue commands to the body. Cause and effect. A connection machine. 

Which is to say that you...are a connection machine. Anyone else, parent or priest, who tries to tell you otherwise is peddling used snake oil. Don’t get me wrong, this machine’s complexity and elegance rivals any else in nature. But when you really dissect it down to the nitty gritty we are all just half-cognizant switches briefly flickering between on and off. 

Exiting the Nexus the terrain levels off and the lights go out as I drop further into the Boxes. Rows and columns of prefabricated apartments, stacked one on top of each other like schizophrenic brickyards. I can barely see the streets here, narrow enough to make you catch your breath. But I know what is down there. Ghetto, squalor and crime. Everything this city runs on. Sacrificial offerings to the god of prosperity. You might know him by his formal name, automation. Automation leads to unemployment which gives rise to crime. Everything Connected. 

Finally, looming over the horizon, is that hammerhead monument to justice. The irreproachable San Franciscan Police Department. My interceptor lands on the roof and I ride the grindy elevator down to the catacombs. After way too much searching around I locate the forensics department where the android’s dissection is already in full swing.

There is a tech peering delicately into his juniper green terminal screen. “I hate to tell you guys this” he says “but there ain’t much here. Someone must have hit auto-delete...wiped his mind clean on the way out.” 

Mitch, the technician and I are crammed together in a small room with dissonant lighting and the obnoxious smell of formaldehyde. I am resting against a countertop beside a unwashed washing sink. Next to this is an grimy coffee machine and a basket of overripe bananas swarming with fruit flies. 

In the middle of the room, lying stripped-naked on a steel gurney, is our perpetrator. The tech has his porcelain skull opened up, various wires snaking into the silicon cobweb of his processor unit. Mitch holds a kleenex dabbing blood from his newly fractured nose. 

“Try defragmenting.” Mitch says trying to appear confident “See if we can recover anything that way.”

“One second...” The tech phonetically tapping into his keyboard while I plug in the coffee machine.

“...no, nothing. Overwritten and scrubbed to naughts.”

“Impossible, only way to do that is if you have the factory encryption codes.”

“Which were likely demolished,” I say “along with the factory itself years ago.” In the top cabinet to the left, next to plastic utensils and accumulating dust, is a tin canister of old coffee grinds which I gladly scoop out into the machine. “Check for serial numbers.”

Mitch pulls a knife from his boot, then filets open the android’s right foot, cutting midline from toes to heel. Synthetic padding, the texture of cottage cheese, spills from the wound. Brushing this away Mitch reveals the bone. My coffee percolates.

“Reads...no, fucking way. They filed this off too. Means this unit was probably stolen and traded on the black market.” 

“Coffee?” I raise my cup to him.

Mitch looks frustrated but nods. I pour him a cup of joe. Then an idea occurs to me. I snatch one of the gnats out of mid air. Discreetly. Then pass the coffee over to MItch. 

“Got any sugar?”

I toss him two sugar packets which Mitch empties into his mug. Then, rising from his seat Mitch strolls over to the corner where the tech had unceremoniously piled the android's clothing. Fishing in the garment pile, Mitch retrieves the suit jacket. He holds up the inseam lapel for us to see where someone has embroidered a name. “Ghezzi.”

I feed the name into my subdermal and a holo-map springs into existence above my wrist. “High-end professional tailor. Custom suits by design. Owned a small shop on Balboa Avenue until…”

Mitch takes a sip from his coffee and then immediately spits this over the floor. “What the…there is a dead fly in this coffee.”

“My humblest apologies monsieur.” I grab Mitch’s coffee, bowing flamboyantly and retreating back to the coffee maker. “I shall fetch a new cup for you at once.” 

“You were saying?” The tech, whom I had forgotten was even in the room, asks impatiently.

“...until the shop burned down to the ground six months ago. With the tailor Ghezzi inside.” 

MItch slams his fist down hard enough to leave a dent in the gurney. “So where does that leave us?”

“Coroner is working on the girl. He says he needs six hours to prepare a decent report. Means we just have to wait.”

There is an awkward silence. 

“Screw this I need a smoke.” Mitch grumbles. 

I grab the coffee cup and follow Mitch out of forensics. We take the elevator to street level and exit via the station lobby. 

We are standing outside in the courtyard entrance to SFPD, watching night shifters trickle into the building. In the center of the courtyard are the bones of a once gigantic white tree. Broad and gnarled with a broken crown and bark fossilized into chalk. It had been a bristlecone pine, one of the last unengineered trees on the west coast. I know this cause the bronze plaque next to where we are standing says so.

Now most people, when they look at a neuron, see something akin to a tree. Beautiful dendritic branches soaking up chemical sunlight. Electrical signals flowing down an axonal trunk. Terminating into the widespread roots, only to propagate onto the next neuron ad infinitum. That is how most people see the neuron. Myself, I never see the tree. To me the neuron only resembles one thing. A radioactive mushroom cloud blooming over a still dying world. After all that's really all a connection is. A means to an end. 

“You forgot this” I hand Mitch the coffee.

“I can already tell you what this is going to be.” Mitch says dousing his cigarette on the plaque. “Another stone cold dead end. Cases that start out like this always end that way. Unsolved.”

“Not this one.” I say.

Peeking over his cig, Mitch frowns. “...and how do you know that?”

“Because I have never had an unsolved case.”

I take out a business card, flipping it between my fingers and handing it over to Mitch.

“This is the motel I am currently staying at. Meet me there in an hour. I have something I need to take care of first but, I figure I owe you a drink.” I spiral my finger around my own nose. “Cause of the...you know.”

Mitch takes another sip of his coffee as I walk away then spits it out again. “This is the same fucking cup of coffee! You just picked out the fly. What the fuck is wrong with you?”

I smile to myself as I head down the street. The detective wasn’t quite as stupid as he looked. I walk east through the night and towards my hotel. He might even be useful.



","[sps] Synaptica: Connections **Connections**


In the academy we have a saying. Everything connected.

It means exactly what it sounds like. Mathematical functions, quantum strings, chemical bonds, nucleotide pairs…all the universe defined and interdependent upon all the rest of the universe. But to the Synaptica there is one connection of paramount importance. And that is the neuron. For if you can manipulate the neuron you can control the fate of man. 

The woman hung from the radio tower, naked and upside down, legs nailed together as if she were JC superstar, platinum blonde hair streaked with blood and flapping across her face like a plastic bag in a storm. 

“We found her like this,” the patrolman announces “about an hour ago, neighbor who lives in the high rise across the way called it in. Said it looked like someone was trying to climb the antenna. Then when we got here we found her...like that.”

“And the android?” I ask.

The patrolman motions towards the rooftop ledge. I follow, stepping gingerly over the police tape, shoes crunching on the frosty gravel as we approach the figure tucked against the parapet wall. The light from my subdermal implant cutting through the midnight gloom until it falls upon this pretzeled man, still leaking antifreeze from his head. iHuman assistant, 2063 model. Dressed in a slim-fit charcoal suit with a black tie and cotton white shirt. Freshly groomed shave job and immaculately clean fingernails. Perfect gentleman were it not for his limbs, snapped in half and bent backwards as if he had suddenly metamorphosed into some giant dead insect. Heels folded onto his spine, head buried in his own contorted hands. Madonna wept.

“Why do they do that?” The patrolman questions keeping his distance.

“Do what?”

“Bend like that?”

“Decerebrate posturing. Indicates terminal circuit damage. Everything above the red nucleus must be fried. Did you move him?”

“No. No one has touched a thing.”

I crouch over the machine. Taking a fountain pen out from my coat pocket and with it sliding a hand from the robot’s face, revealing two empty sockets where eyes used to be, now crusting over with aquamarine gel. 

“Shit.” the patrolman exclaims. “Clawed his fucking eyes out. Why would he, why would he do that?”

I stand up, canvasing the rooftop. Pillars of steam rise from chimney pipes. Whirling air conditioners. Tetris ductwork pinging like only heated metal can. 

“Why would an android do any of this?” I counter, pacing back to the woman and trying to gauge how high off the ground she really was. Then from behind me comes another voice, deeper and rough, like gargled sand in tonic water.

“Who the fuck is this?” 

I turn to see this police officer emerging from the rooftop accessway and marching past the taped off perimeter. He is big, grizzled and raw, like a shark out of water. Some dried up genealogy with nothing else to lose. Black combat fatigues, ex-military then. Hair beginning to edge grey but the pumped iron biceps of someone half his age. Cigarette pinched between the whirling articulation of his prosthetic arm until he flicks the bud casually over the ledge.

“Is anyone going to answer me?” He barks getting closer. “You guys let someone else onto my crime scene, no one thought to ask me. Last time I checked I run mech Ops. That still correct?”

“Synaptic.” Patrolman whispers.

“What?”

“She is Synaptic. Federal agent.”

There is silence on the rooftop as the detective chews this over. My eyes are still glued up on our victim however, trying to piece together just how the android got her all the way up the antenna. I rest my hand on the scaffolding while the detective attempts to compose himself. The metal is as cold as November.

“Ahem.” The officer coughs with every ounce of his self restraint. Out the corner of my eye I can see him extending his gauntlet at me. 

“Mitch Connors. District Investigator. Mechanical Operations.”

“Cerpin Vex.” I say barely acknowledging him. Hoisting myself up onto the antenna instead and climbing hand over hand up the metal lattice towards my down-on-her-luck Rapunzel. 

“They, uh, sent you down here to…”

“You ever see a case like this?” I ask.

“A case like this, no. I can’t say that I…”

“A malfunction.”

Mitch crosses his arm, looking back and forth from the enucleated android to the femme fatale. 

“Android malfunction? Shit many times. Back when I was a cadet this was all we’d get. 10-16’s like night and day.” He fakes a bad impression of a lil-ol-lady.”’My robot is trying to kill me!’ But that was before they had quite figured out the logic algorithms. There hasn’t been a case like this in…”

“Eighteen years. May 3rd, 2119. Outside Detroit. That was the last confirmed malfunction.”

“Yeah,” Mitch perplexed but mostly uninterested “...if you say so.”

Still climbing I reach the woman. Extend my arm to grab her skull. Digging my fingernails hard into her scalp I look for for ghosts. 

This is getting painfully basic but for the sake of having everyone on the same page, we will start at the beginning. A neuron is an excitable cell, in the same way as an electrocution chamber. Neurons are microscopic units of life with only one purpose, to carry an electrical signal from one point in space to another. Occasionally, these little bastards will modify the strength or the frequency of the signal. But they don’t think. They don’t communicate with the beyond. They just transmit. 

And underneath my fingernails are the receivers. SQUIDS. Superconducting quantum interface devices. Sensitive enough to detect and decode the cacophony of magneto-encephalographic waves emitted by a human brain. The first of many psycho-surgical “gifts” implanted into a young Synaptic. A tool allowing us, for lack of a better phrase, to read minds. 

Normally this would allow me to crack the woman's mind. Even freshly expired brains could be momentarily jump-started for one encor clue. But it doesn’t take me long to realize that this time no one’s home. She’s likely been dead for hours. I pull my hand away, brushing off flecks of that blue gel when something else catches my attention and I lean in. A small copper necklace dangling around her engorged throat, with an inverted cross at the end. I snap the cross from her neck and begin my descent back to the rooftop. 

“Can I get you an evidence bag for that?” Mitch calls up. “Maybe follow some fucking crime scene protocols.” I ignore him as I climb back down. 

As I drop the last few feet to the ground, Mitch, who has been inspecting the other android, stands up. 

“The eyes are kinda weird. I mean he clawed out her eyes, strung her up there and then took out his own?

“No.” I tell him, picking residual coolant from my fingernails “He did his eyes first. She still has his blue fluid stuck in her hair.”

“So he hauled her up there and nailed her in completely blind?”

“Would appear so.”

I stop at the rooftop access, an itch on the back of my mind screaming that the calculation was in error. Turn back to the crime scene, the woman, the android, the trillion chromatic lights of the city beyond. 

“Get the vic's body down” I order “and packaged off to forensics. The android as well.”

Then I am gone, descending the condominium stairwell. Trying to ignore the water damage trickling down the cinderblock wall or the misaligned checkerboard tiling. This is what always happened when a Synaptic was activated. One by one the implants start to wake up. Rolling over, taking over until you, the person you were, was just a memory along for the ride. Piggy backing on a philosophical zombie in an OCD search for answers. 

This right here, that new found uncanny attention to detail, that was my Abacampus. Tucked neatly beside my thalamus, this cybernetic implant was an voracious consumer of input. Picking out every minute detail from my sensorium. Scribbling them across my cortex in indelibly red ink. 

I am halfway down this rabbit hole when the detective bursts through the doorway two stories above. 

“What the fuck do you think your doing?” Mitch yells at me over the banister railing.

“My job, Detective Connors.”

“This is my precinct,” he shouts, taking stairs two at a time  “android malfunction falls under mech Ops jurisdiction. Why is pre-crime even involved here...she’s...she is dead already!”

“Detective Connors, do you know how many iHuman units there are in this city?”

“No but…”

“No one does. That’s how ubiquitous they are. And since the company that manufactured them went bankrupt there is no central registrar available to track them all down. Makes mass recall all but impossible. Which means that if these machines are capable of killing again it’ is a big fucking deal.”

My feet slide to halt and I round on the detective. “Which is why they sent me. Now I am sorry if you feel my department is stepping on toes but that's how it is sweetheart. Don't like it, you can piss off. Or you can tag along, watching, while the professionals stop a goddamn catastrophe.” I resume marching down the stairs but Connors has not had enough. He follows me. 

“That’s all well and good, Ms. whatever-your-name-was. But I’ve run this beat since you were sucking thumbs, with a damn fine track records and...hold your fucking panties, I ain’t done with you…”

He grabs my jacket and I snap. Jackknifing the palm of my hand up towards his nose. Aimed such that the nasal bones will be fragment into his frontal cortex. An instantly lethal blow. At the last second my sympathies intervene and I curl my fingers instead into a fist. My punch knocks him to the cinderblock wall, but does not kill him. He slumps against the floor clutching at his now broken nose as I step over him.

“Detective Connors, do not ever touch me again. I am heading to the station. You can meet me in forensics if you want to be there when we open the can. Or not.” Then I resume walking down the stairs.

My interceptor is waiting for me in the garage. I saddle into the vehicle and program coordinates for SFPD. M-foils unfolding as the grav-car lifts away from the parking slot and makes its way out of the skyrise garage. Fliting out into the night to join the technicolor of downtown air traffic. Through the windshield, virtual rails guide my ride on collision rendezvous with our destination. I can see raindrops beginning to dot the glass. 

The city spreads out below me like an underpaid call girl, beautiful yet venereal. My car weaves through what was left of the sky, artificial canyons rising on all sides, ever higher as I enter into the Nexus proper. Towering corporate structures merging one on top of the other until it is all just concrete tesseract. Size and perspective being luxuries one can’t afford when you are this rich. Around me dance the real denizens of this place, holographic advertisements and commercialized paraphernalia. Blink and the neon billboard in front of you has morphed into a styrofoam cup of joe. Marketing algorithms reading your mind almost as well as a Synaptica could. I really could go for a cup of coffee. 

The brain, that was where we left off. Your precious, unique, incomprehensible brain. Seated at the right hand of the almighty and just left of an ear. It brings me no joy to confess this but this organ, for all intents and purposes, is an overrated computer. Here is how it works. Afferent neurons carry sensory input from the universe. This information is processed through a complex web of interneurons. Then efferent neurons issue commands to the body. Cause and effect. A connection machine. 

Which is to say that you...are a connection machine. Anyone else, parent or priest, who tries to tell you otherwise is peddling used snake oil. Don’t get me wrong, this machine’s complexity and elegance rivals any else in nature. But when you really dissect it down to the nitty gritty we are all just half-cognizant switches briefly flickering between on and off. 

Exiting the Nexus the terrain levels off and the lights go out as I drop further into the Boxes. Rows and columns of prefabricated apartments, stacked one on top of each other like schizophrenic brickyards. I can barely see the streets here, narrow enough to make you catch your breath. But I know what is down there. Ghetto, squalor and crime. Everything this city runs on. Sacrificial offerings to the god of prosperity. You might know him by his formal name, automation. Automation leads to unemployment which gives rise to crime. Everything Connected. 

Finally, looming over the horizon, is that hammerhead monument to justice. The irreproachable San Franciscan Police Department. My interceptor lands on the roof and I ride the grindy elevator down to the catacombs. After way too much searching around I locate the forensics department where the android’s dissection is already in full swing.

There is a tech peering delicately into his juniper green terminal screen. “I hate to tell you guys this” he says “but there ain’t much here. Someone must have hit auto-delete...wiped his mind clean on the way out.” 

Mitch, the technician and I are crammed together in a small room with dissonant lighting and the obnoxious smell of formaldehyde. I am resting against a countertop beside a unwashed washing sink. Next to this is an grimy coffee machine and a basket of overripe bananas swarming with fruit flies. 

In the middle of the room, lying stripped-naked on a steel gurney, is our perpetrator. The tech has his porcelain skull opened up, various wires snaking into the silicon cobweb of his processor unit. Mitch holds a kleenex dabbing blood from his newly fractured nose. 

“Try defragmenting.” Mitch says trying to appear confident “See if we can recover anything that way.”

“One second...” The tech phonetically tapping into his keyboard while I plug in the coffee machine.

“...no, nothing. Overwritten and scrubbed to naughts.”

“Impossible, only way to do that is if you have the factory encryption codes.”

“Which were likely demolished,” I say “along with the factory itself years ago.” In the top cabinet to the left, next to plastic utensils and accumulating dust, is a tin canister of old coffee grinds which I gladly scoop out into the machine. “Check for serial numbers.”

Mitch pulls a knife from his boot, then filets open the android’s right foot, cutting midline from toes to heel. Synthetic padding, the texture of cottage cheese, spills from the wound. Brushing this away Mitch reveals the bone. My coffee percolates.

“Reads...no, fucking way. They filed this off too. Means this unit was probably stolen and traded on the black market.” 

“Coffee?” I raise my cup to him.

Mitch looks frustrated but nods. I pour him a cup of joe. Then an idea occurs to me. I snatch one of the gnats out of mid air. Discreetly. Then pass the coffee over to MItch. 

“Got any sugar?”

I toss him two sugar packets which Mitch empties into his mug. Then, rising from his seat Mitch strolls over to the corner where the tech had unceremoniously piled the android's clothing. Fishing in the garment pile, Mitch retrieves the suit jacket. He holds up the inseam lapel for us to see where someone has embroidered a name. “Ghezzi.”

I feed the name into my subdermal and a holo-map springs into existence above my wrist. “High-end professional tailor. Custom suits by design. Owned a small shop on Balboa Avenue until…”

Mitch takes a sip from his coffee and then immediately spits this over the floor. “What the…there is a dead fly in this coffee.”

“My humblest apologies monsieur.” I grab Mitch’s coffee, bowing flamboyantly and retreating back to the coffee maker. “I shall fetch a new cup for you at once.” 

“You were saying?” The tech, whom I had forgotten was even in the room, asks impatiently.

“...until the shop burned down to the ground six months ago. With the tailor Ghezzi inside.” 

MItch slams his fist down hard enough to leave a dent in the gurney. “So where does that leave us?”

“Coroner is working on the girl. He says he needs six hours to prepare a decent report. Means we just have to wait.”

There is an awkward silence. 

“Screw this I need a smoke.” Mitch grumbles. 

I grab the coffee cup and follow Mitch out of forensics. We take the elevator to street level and exit via the station lobby. 

We are standing outside in the courtyard entrance to SFPD, watching night shifters trickle into the building. In the center of the courtyard are the bones of a once gigantic white tree.

I know this cause the bronze plaque next to where we are standing says so.

Our Spoiler Free Review of Captive State,,Our Spoiler Free Review of Captive State 
[Self-Promo Saturday] More Than Bad Intentions - a fantasy novel,"Yesterday I published the English edition of my novel, “More Than Bad Intentions”.  

It is a funny fantasy story, where the action develops at a rapid pace, and we can follow the main character’s journey through amazing lands to a surprising finale.

For Darreth, a young demon, exiled from Hell, the most desirable object is the Jewel giving power to rule his native dimension. The search for it leads him through lands of Earth, Fables, Nightmare, Absurdity and Hell itself, but the closer he gets to the goal, the less he wants the Jewel. During the adventure he discovers more and more intrigues, and nothing, including demons and angels, is what it seems.

[SPS] Deeper Darker - a dungeon crawler/space opera online serial.,"My online serial **[DEEPER DARKER](http://moodylit.com/deeper-darker-table-of-contents/prologue)** is now live on my site. It's a sci-fi dungeon crawler/space opera, posting five days a week.  (22 chapters up so far, 27 on Patreon).  
&amp;nbsp; 

Set in the far future when humanity has reached the stars and finds it is not the first to do so. Alien technology has been left behind by a long dead race. Ancient cities, abandoned starships, temples and fortified bunkers all contain artefacts and devices far in advance of what humans have been able to produce. Technology that feels more akin to magic, so powerful it can allow a single person to dominate a star system. But these relics of another time have been left well-defended and behind bewildering and impenetrable security measures. 

There are those who are compatible with the alien technology, who can augment themselves to face the evermore extreme protocols in the depths of the alien ruins, and by doing so attain greater power. And there are those who just want to sell what they find to the highest bidder.

The rewards are high, but you have to be prepared to go further and risk more to discover the greatest secrets of a civilisation that vanished long before the first human walked upright. Secrets that could irrevocably change humanity's future, or end it.

"I,robot"," 

Asimov  was the greatest auther in 20th century science fiction and popular  science writer . Do you like which of his novel fictions and why ?

He  wrote a number of stories that involved sentient robots, starting with  the most well-known, I, Robot, in 1950. They included the idea that the  robots were programmed to follow the “Three Laws of Robotics”:

A  robot may not injure a human being or, though inaction, allow a human  being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders given it by human  beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A  robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not  conflict with the First or Second Laws. These “laws” were one of the  earliest frameworks for discussing the ethics of AI.","I,robot

Novel: Aleph Zero,"Hi guys. I'd like to share with you the news that I've started the pre-sale of my first novel, *Álef Zero* (in english, it's Aleph Zero), a cyberpunk history set in Buenos Aires, Argentina (yeah, it's in spanish! Though I have plans for an english translation). This has been the culmination of a hard journey of two years of work, delving into parkour, science prototypes, economic and ecological forecasts.

As I said, it's on pre-sale, to be distributed when I present the book publicly. That's the start of May !I can also remotely print it other countries of Latin America (though I think Brazil and Venezuela are not included) and Spain.

I hope you consider sharing it with your latino pals!

WIRED - This was made a few years ago with less than $100 as a student project. Check out WIRED,"Check out WIRED [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhiwEleFgo)

One of our crew members made this back in 2012-ish as a student project at Emerson College. It stars a few of our friends and the main actor is another one of our crew members. We got really lucky back then filmed this in the basement of our main actor. Most of that stuff was already in there -the sink, the stones, the mirror. We couldn't believe how lucky we got.

All of the lighting was done with just normal household lightbulbs and desk lamps. We threw some lighting gels over some of them and that was pretty much it. All of the props were just stuff laying around our apartments (any music producers out there will recognize some of the equipment used haha). We pretty much just spent money on the makeup and the glasses.

About us- We've just started up a little film production crew out in LA and currently have 4 projects in various stages of production. We've already released one (the first video on our page) and should have the next one ready pretty soon. Until then, we've been digging out videos that each of us have made before we together.

Hope you dig it!","WIRED - This was made a few years ago with less than $100 as a student project. Check out WIRED Check out WIRED [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhiwEleFgo)

* Moderately accessable (Greg Egan is probably not a good choice)
* Space operas over something like The Wind Up Girl or Blackfish City (Blackfish City is my backup plan)
* Clever or funny
* Well written (I love schlocky stuff but my wife will kill me) 
* Preferably standalone, but at the least self contained

Looking for a hard to find kind of sci-fi,"My two favorite Star Trek episodes are who watches the watchers and first contact. In both of them, the enterprise stumbles across a less advanced culture and blows their minds with advanced tech. I've been searching for media where primitives freak out at advanced tech for pretty much my entire life. The cultural exchange of those type of stories has always interested me. My search has taken me to books like 1632, island in the sea of time, and destroyermen where a small enclave of the modern world is transported to a primitive one. Games like horizon zero dawn where the main characters uncover the story behind the advanced tech of their past. And to the anime gate, where the modern Japanese military goes to war with a fantasy world similar to lord of the rings. I often brows the crossover fan fiction to scratch this itch. In most media, the initial first contact is breezed through because the authors want to get to the good part. The conflict normally doesn't come from the culture shock most of the time and it infuriates me. You skipped over the good part. I want something that focuses on that.

Recommendations for character driven stories with ethical themes?,"Calling all recommendations! I’ve always loved sci fi and fantasy, but recently I’ve been going through a reading/TV/movie slump and just can’t seem to find anything to really get into. I’ve been watching the X-Men movies for the first time (I know, I’m a little late to the party!) and while I like all of them well enough, I really loved First Class because of the character drama and ethical themes. Does anyone have recommendations for books, movies, or shows like that? I really like stories where the drama comes from the characters rather than epic fight scenes/fate of the world in the balance stuff.  I think what set First Class apart from the other X-Men movies for me was how it explored the relationship between Erik and Charles and their opposing ethical perspectives.

However, he is better known as “The Northern Cowboy” throughout Earth and neighbouring planets. Now you see, The Cowboy was a hero to the people of Earth. That voice in the back, the man known as Stripes was a hero as well, or he was until he lost his entire physical body in the biggest battle in human history.

The society in this time may been advanced one, but it still has its conflicts. Now, one of these conflicts made these men heroes, The Battle for Humanity was the largest battle in human history. The entire species divided, two massive armies lead by two political groups went head to head. The Planetarian group; a party that believes the population should merge and become one nationality to be recognized as human. Then, there's the Individuals, people wanting the borders to remain on our planet and to preserve cultures. The decision for the dominant party wasn’t one to be made in a courtroom, no one could decide on a party to put in charge. The dominant half needed to rise. Was it time for drastic change? Or was it time to preserve? That is what this fight would’ve decided.

The two armies clashed all over the solar system and fought for 12 whole years in continuous battle. Now this fight never ended, it was stopped. Stopped by exactly 390 heroes, two men or women from each country on Earth stood tall and decided to rally and stop this war. This was seen as an impossible feat for any normal human, but these people weren’t normal, they were extraordinary. They possessed abilities and powers only a fraction of the human race had. Some people were born with their abilities, like it was the next step of human evolution, others acquired them through science or an altering incident of some sort; these people were like folklore of their home countries, mere myths. However, the myths soon became reality when these people aligned with one another. Using their abilities, they arrived in the middle of the front lines of every battle between both armies and held them off. Eventually, these armies stopped their clash and listened to what these heroes had to say. These incredible men and women were seen as gods among mortals, and the leaders of both sides decided that if these people found a way to stop the fight and bring the society together, it would be worth listening to and trying. Soon after the war ended, a united party was formed and governed all of humanity. The Planet Earth Society was formed; a society that kept our individualities present on Earth, but we explored the cosmos and functioned our government as one species.

Now, back to our two heroes. The Northern Cowboy was a hero out of Canada, and Stripes was his partner out of the states. These men had some extremely powerful abilities; Stripes, a once massively built man, had the power to control electronics and machines with his mind, and The Cowboy, a tall man who stood at about 6’1 with two different coloured eyes, one black and one blue, had the ability to generate and manipulate lightning out of his body. All heroes were as strong as this, if not more. So obviously, it was no wonder they were able to stop the imminent war. However, the victory didn't come without its share of sacrifices. Stripes was gunned down between the two armies. A seasoned war vet like himself couldn’t avoid his own demise at the age of 42. But as a last act of desperation, he transferred his consciousness into the computer in the Star Horse, their ship; Immortalizing himself into his own starcruiser. Now, The Cowboy had his own tragedies as well, involving the death of the other Canadian hero... but we’ll get to that later.

“Where are we Stripes?” the Cowboy asked groggily, “About 300 miles away from the Red Dust Casino, in the Mars Orbit.” Every planet with a ground to stand on had been terraformed so that it was habitable for humans, and Mars was like the Las Vegas of the solar system, a planet for the rich and famous. “Are we making a pitstop, kid?” Stripes asked. The Man nodded, “Yeah but this ain’t for pleasure, we’ve got business to attend to at the Red Dust Grand Hotel”. Stripes replied, “Alright Cowboy I’ll bring us down for a landing-” The Cowboy interrupted, “Hold it, stop over top of the Crimson Canyon, I’ve got something to do first. Open the hanger for me would ya?” After a morning cigarette and a shot of whisky for breakfast, The Northern Cowboy boarded his one man fighter; a black, modified advanced secret service ship with a hand-painted white stripe down the middle. On the side of the fighter was a name painted in red, it read “Le Pew”. The Cowboy fired up his engines and shot out of the ship, and right into the depths of the canyon.

The canyon The Cowboy had just ventured into was a place named Futurado Gorge. This canyon had a reputation all around the star system of being a dangerous death trap that only fools would venture into. So knowing this, Stripes questioned his partner's motives and speaks over the comm, “Hey Kid what the hell are ya doin’ divin’ into a place like this?” He responds, “Don't worry about it Stripes I know what I'm doing”, “alright whatever kid”. The Cowboy had discovered a while back that the water in this cave had unusual properties to it; the water allowed the person who touched it to see parts of their future, so being the clever guy that he is, he uses it to his advantages sometimes. When the Cowboy reached the bottom of the gorge, he got out of his ship and knelt down and touched the water…

The Cowboy’s eyes lit up for a moment and then he saw his entire life flash before his eyes, and then the vision showed itself to him, he sat back, shook his hands dry, and lit a cigarette. After a few minutes of pondering, he stood up and shrugged. He spoke to himself, “So that's how I go, huh? It's a bit sooner than I would’ve thought. Oh well, guess it can’t be helped” He threw his cigarette into the water and got back into his ship.

On the top floor of the Red Dust Casino, there’s a meeting between two men. One man is a criminal who runs the Casino and uses it for a drug and money laundering scheme to supply dealers throughout the solar system. His name is Isaac Pantangellini, an average height man but powerfully built nonetheless, he had tanned skin with jet black hair slicked back into a mullet. The other man was a short and unhealthily thin young man called Mouse, with matted brown hair and sharp facial features; he is a bright young man in the drug business; but it seems he’s bit off more than he can chew with his most recent scam.

Pantangellini started his rant towards Mouse by puffing his own ego a bit. He speaks aggressively, “Look dipshit, you don’t know who you fucked with. I own this casino and the resort, I’m not the manager or the bouncer, I'm the OWNER. I'm also a man who doesn’t put up with nobody’s shit, I have half of all the Mars cops on my payroll and the other half knows they can’t screw with me, I OWN this town. So tell me this kid, WHAT IN THE NAME OF JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU TRIED TO SCAM ME?!” Mouse responds with a cool ignorance towards the riled up mob boss, “To be honest, what I thought would happen is that I’d grab one of the cases of money you launder through this joint to cover your drug business, and then I’d escape and you’d never see me again. But ya know what? You can go eat Venus Baboon shit, you fogey, I don’t care if ya caught me” Pantangellini was fuming mad from his disrespectful demeanor. He stood up from his desk, pulled a gun out of the holster concealed by his blazer, held it over Mouse’s head and brought the base of the gun onto the bridge of the kid’s nose so hard the cartilage in his face was smashed into oblivion and his cheekbones were shattered. Mouse crumpled to the floor after falling out of his chair. The casino boss pointed to his two henchmen at the door, “Hey you two, take this asswipe out back and put as many bullets as you want into the back of his head.” He then pointed to the blood on his marble floor and said, “Oh and get someone to clean this mess up.”

At that very moment, The Cowboy touched down into the casino’s ship lot and parked his vessel there and put on his red trench coat, “Are ya gonna pay for the valet service kid?” asked Stripes, “Fuck no, I’m not made of money pal” The Cowboy responded. “What happened to givin’ back to the community?” asked Stripes. His partner talks back through the comm, “We gave up that hero of the people stuff remember? We do this to get paid now” “Just givin’ ya hell kid, lighten up a bit would ya?” The Cowboy sighed and walked towards the back door of the casino; just as he approached the door, it was slammed open and out rushed two burly men in suits dragging a badly beaten, sickly looking young man who was unhealthily thin. The men passed the Cowboy. The ex-hero took a few more steps before stopping, cursing himself as he turned around to walk towards the men. The men had the beaten man on his knees with a gun to the back of his head. The Cowboy approached the men and obnoxiously asked, “Hey do any of you boys got a light?” One of the men turned on the stranger who had just approached him and pulled a gun on him, “Woah easy partner, I just need a light.” The Cowboy said passively. The man responds, “Piss off punk, or you're next”. The Cowboy continued to walk towards the thug, unfazed by the gun pointed in his direction. The thug fired. In a flash of blue light, the bullet seemed to miss its mark and then the thug was on the ground writhing in pain.

The Cowboy stood over the thug, stepped over his crumpled body and approached the second man. The second thug turned around and pulled his gun on the Cowboy. In a seemingly effortless motion the Cowboy had smashed the man's leg with a side kick and landed a knee to the man’s chest. The thug staggered for a minute and stood up again, firing away at the ex-hero. The Cowboy leapt out of the way of the bullets and snapped his fingers at the man and simply said “Bang”. Lightning shot out of the Cowboy’s hand and sent the thug flying a good 100 yards away. The Cowboy turned and walked away, lighting a cigarette. He looked over his shoulder and said to the beaten man, “Get to a hospital yourself, I’m not your fuckin’ babysitter”

The Cowboy sat at the casino bar and took a look around the place, a lively venue with a gold color pallette on seemingly every surface. The place was filled with people all dressed up in tuxedos and fancy silk dresses surrounding gambling tables and blackjack pits. The barmaid took a look at the Cowboy and was intrigued, he didn’t look the part of a gambler, he wore a casual, but wrinkled, black suit with a white shirt and black tie, and a faded red trench coat overtop. She walked over to him at the end of the bar and started talking “Howdy stranger, what corner of the stars did you wander in from?” He calmly replies, “Oh a place a lot worse than this one, can you get me an Old Fashioned?” She made him the drink and placed it in front of him, he knocked it back in a couple long gulps and then asked, “Do you know how to get to the top floor? I’ve got to have a chat with the man who runs this joint” She was less interested in the man now, “Oh he’s just another drug dealer here to see the guy upstairs” she thought. She then asked him “Here to close a deal?” “No sweetheart I'm here for him” he replied as he pointed upwards. She then asked,”A hitman?” The Cowboy replied, “Not quite, thanks for the drink” and got up and left without paying. He only left a bullet, sliced in half and scorched, on his napkin.

The first floor service elevator doors were always locked in the casino, it was the way to get up to the top floor office where Pantangellini hid out. The Cowboy walked up to the doors and pried them open and opened the top hatch in the elevator. He then used his lightning to charge the cable and the elevator shot upwards, he stopped it when it got to the top, he composed himself for a moment and blasted the doors open. The men in the office were startled by the massive explosion coming from the elevator and the doors shattering, which followed the initial bang. Out stepped the Cowboy, through a cloud of dust coming from the door. “Hey your elevator kinda sucks, the doors wouldn’t open” he said cooly. All the men in the room, including Pantangellini  pulled their guns and fired into the dust and at the man that stood before them. The Cowboy walked backwards into the dust in the midst of the gunfire. After a minute or two of continuous fire, Pantangellini was shoved from behind. Everyone turned around shocked, to see the Cowboy behind the men, he had moved so fast no one had seen him get behind them. The Cowboy took Pantangellini’s gun from his hands with a quick jerk, and fired into all the men’s shoulders and knees; except for the mob boss who was now shaking in fear.

The Ex-hero kneeled down and was face to face with the criminal. He spoke, “You’re worth a fat $300 000 bounty Pantangellini. It seems like the all cops weren’t under your control, and that bounty’s all mine” Pantangellini was somewhat relieved he wasn’t going to be killed. He had to be brought in alive. “Stripes call the cops to the top floor, I’m not bringing him to ‘em” he said over his comm. “Alright Cowboy” his partner responds. The mob boss on the floor, who had now soiled himself, spoke with some confidence now that he knew he wasn’t going to be shot. He looked up at the man who had just brought him down and spoke, “You’re a filthy fuckin’ bounty hunter, you won’t last a week! You hear! YOU’RE DEAD! WHO ARE YOU?!” As if it was scripted, the Cowboy lights a cigarette and says in his trademark nonchalant tone, “Who me? Well, I’m just an old fashioned cowboy”.

On the other side of the asteroid belt orbiting Titan, one of Saturn’s moons, there was a large cruiser. The cruiser was owned by the Syndicate Of The Blue Moon, the largest crime organization in the solar system. The Syndicate was the unofficial ruler of the criminal underworld, they had immense power and resources; that of which rivaled the government. These people were no joke and certainly nothing to be taken lightly, their leader was a cruel and powerful man with incredible abilities. His name, The Midnight Gladiator. He could control and generate fire, giving him the ability to conjure immense blazes and destroy anything in his path. The Gladiator stood at a solid six feet tall, he wore a black suit and pants, with a scarred face and a head of white hair, despite him actually being quite young. He was a  truly frightening man, who showed no mercy to anyone.

The Gladiator sat on a throne in the main chamber of his vessel with a man whimpering on the floor before him. The man begged for his life, “No please, I am so, so utterly sorry. You will have my undying loyalty if you let this go, please stop. Spare me! S-spare me, let me live!” The man stammered on, sniveling on the floor as he begged. The Gladiator grew impatient, “SHUT UP!” he roared. He approached the man and grabbed his face by his chin and spoke directly to the man, “I don’t accept failure, that package needed to get there. You have failed, you are worthless to me now. I have no use for you.” The Gladiator covered the man’s face with his hand, which grew hotter and hotter as his grip tightened. Soon a blaze erupted out of his hand and the man’s head was incinerated into ashes, the screaming died out as his headless body fell to the floor. Two men in suits rushed over and started to drag the body away. There was a knock at the door to the main chamber and a man with glasses who had a rather weak demeanor, donning a bland brown suit, walked in.

“What is it Genco?” The Gladiator asked. “It's Pantangellini” he said, nervously adding “He got life inside, a bounty hunter got ‘em’” The man of flame was concerned, “Well shit, there goes our best money launderer, we’ve gotta get a new casino” he continued “Genco, who was the bounty hunter that nailed him?” In a weak tone, Genco spoke to his boss, “We didn’t get a name, all Pantangellini said was that the man just told him he was a cowboy.” The Gladiator’s attention spiked, “What did you just say?!” He demanded. A bit frightened now, Genco spoke again “Um… He’s a cowboy sir, that’s all we know, is that alright? Did I do something wrong?” Genco was shaking now, and his stutter started acting up after seeing the burned up body laying on the floor. In a few words, he was fearful for his own life.

“Leave me, and deal with that corpse, you have two minutes.” “Y-yes sir!” Genco ran off dragging the body with the men, all while dry-heaving from the smell of burnt flesh. The Gladiator turned and looked out his window and contemplated what he had just discovered. “The bastard’s still alive! How?! There was no way he could’ve made it out all those years ago.” His mind was racing, The Northern Cowboy was still alive!

**5**

When the Cowboy arrived back on the ship he transferred Stripes his 10% cut of the job. Now you see, Stripes had no need for money; he wasn’t an actual person anymore. He was essentially an A.I. program at this point; the man was immortal now, his consciousness would live on forever. He was just in it for something to do, so a big cut wasn’t really needed for him. Stripes was a curious man and something had been on his mind for a while now, “Hey partner, what did ya see down in that cave the other day?” The Cowboy looked up from the gun he stole on Mars, which he was cleaning, and said simply, “I saw myself die. I died on my knees, burned and beaten. Right on Mercury Bridge, overlooking the sun.” Stripes was surprised, “No shit huh, were you old or what?” “Nope, in fact I looked the same as I am now” Stripes was worried for his partner, he knew the Cowboy would never run from death; he had no fear of it. His fearlessness wasn’t made of bravery, it was something darker.

The man you know as “The Cowboy” is a very peculiar man. He has no fear of anything, he has no cares in the world, he just lives. Day in and day out he is just living for the sake of living. He had a brush with death. He made a grave mistake one day, and ended up looking death in the face and it stole something from him, the ability to care had been stolen from the man. In his eyes, he lived by one belief; “Easy Come, Easy Go”. He is a man who is attached to nothing, he saw no point in getting attached to something if he was just going to die at the end and lose it all, just like it did that fateful day, the day that still haunts him when he sleeps; The day that will never leave him. He welcomes death, he just waits for it to come around the corner and claim him. He’s lost his ability to care, for it was snatched from him by death itself; and every night, he relives the encounter. A man sentenced to psychological torture daily, for as long as he lives, sort of a parting gift from death.

Stripes’ concern grew, he knew for a fact that the Cowboy wouldn’t avoid his own demise; he knew that the Cowboy would face it without a second thought. Stripes didn’t want to lose his brother in arms, “Hey kid, you might wanna avoid Mercury Bridge then eh?” The Cowboy holsters the pistol he stole from the Mob Boss on Mars and spoke, “Meh, I don’t really care, we’ll see what happens I guess”. Stripes, a once strong man, also had no purpose now. He was simply a spirit destined to float through the cosmos for eternity; for his consciousness was immortal, he would always be alive. Now, the thing he valued most, were his comrades. The Cowboy was like a kid brother to him, the only thing tethering him to reality was his only friend.

On the other side of the solar system approaching the asteroid belt, was a fleet the size 200 or so starships. The Syndicate Of The Blue Moon was heading straight for Mars. The Gladiator was looking for someone to answer for his missing money launderer and he was bringing his entire fleet. Pantangellini was a huge part of the money the Gladiator had, he made it clean to use by running it through his casino. It was virtually untraceable by the government; and now it was gone. Taken by some bounty hunter looking for a paycheck.

Now the important thing to remember is that this time period is just as lawless as it is advanced. The solar system may have had government and society, but the underworld of crime was just as large. The two worlds only meet when it comes to one thing, Bounties. The government sometimes wants a certain person and doesn’t want to waste police manpower; with a whole solar system to cover, they need all the help they can get. So the government enlists the help of people looking to make a quick buck. There are two types of bounties, an open contract: where anyone can go and get the target; or a private contract: where a specific person/group gets a contract exclusive to them. The Pantangellini contract was a private one; since Stripes was well known from his days as a hero and from his incredible skill, he gets clearance for high profile/dangerous people the cops want. Therefore, him getting a contract for someone like the casino owning/money launderer wasn’t out of the ordinary; but the fact that he got the Gladiator’s money launderer was some insane coincidence and bad luck for the crime boss.

One thing to mention was that the Gladiator was absolutely livid. He despised bounty hunters in general and the fact that one had gotten one of his most useful assets drove him crazy; on top of that, the man who stole it from him was the person he hated most. The hate was spawned for a reason only known between the two men, and the Gladiator had thought he’d gotten his revenge on the Cowboy and finished him off years ago. However, as both you and I know, the Cowboy is very much alive.

“GENCO!” The man turned a pale shade of grey, “Y-y-yes sir?” Genco stammered in response to the Gladiator. “Find a ship called the Star Horse! I WANT IT FOUND! Spend as much as you need, just get me that ship!” The Gladiator finished his yelling fit towards his assistant and sat down on his throne with a look of death on his face; for he was out for blood and he was going to get it.

**7**

“Well shit, ain’t that a sight huh Stripes?” The Cowboy asked. “Ha, it sure has been a while. What’s it been, five years?” His partner responded. The Star Horse was orbiting the once blue and green planet of Earth. The War had destroyed pretty much all wildlife on the planet, all the forests had cities and skyscrapers built out of the ashes of a once prospering planet. So naturally, the planet had been turned into a blue and grey coloured rock orbiting the sun. Even if it wasn’t the prettiest sight ever, it was their home.

The Cowboy perked up and spoke, “Woah, hey easy Stripes, you haven’t gotten clearance to land yet” Stripes was distracted and seemed distant, even for a non-physical being. “Ah shit my bad, calling in now.” Stripes sent out his ID and got a spot on a landing strip near the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Stripes was having himself some bittersweet nostalgia, the last time he was here on Earth, he lost so much to him. That’s right, the battle when Stripes was confined to his ship forever, were his last moments on Earth. The same went for The Cowboy, he hadn’t returned to the planet since that fateful day either.

The duo had returned to Earth to grab a quick bounty and then get out. To The Cowboy, the faster he could leave, the better. This was mainly because the whole solar system thought he was a dead man who died in the final battle on Earth, who died a hero (they made a plaque for him and everything). It was perfect for him, he hated the whole hero gig; he liked to operate freely and do things he wanted, whenever he wanted. So naturally, the hero committee that was formed put restrictions on how you could act and he hated it; so he never was a huge hero of the people, no one really knew him, he was just a guy who could fight really damn well and he happened to do it for good. So as The Cowboy walked into the setting sun to grab his bounty under the cover of nightfall, he remembered the simpler days…

**2263, Earth, Five Years Prior To Present Day**

Gunfire rained down from above, the varying volume of bombs crashing down indicated their distance from them, screams of the souls lost from the war echoed in the distance. There these two men stood, bullets whizzing around them and above their heads as they stood in their trench. The two men went by names familiar to us both, The Northern Cowboy and The Midnight Gladiator. “They say hell makes two men brothers through the despair they share” said the Gladiator to his comrade. “I guess it does but we were brothers before we got into the fight” The Cowboy responded. The two men were polar opposites, The Gladiator was a fierce warrior who lusted for bloodshed and power; meanwhile, his brother The Cowboy was a cool and collected man who didn’t care much for the war they were fighting. But they were brothers nonetheless; now you see, they weren’t brothers by blood, but by situation.

12 Years ago when the war between humanity began, both men were mere children who had lost their families in the crossfires of the war. At just 11 years old, The Cowboy and The Gladiator were neighbours in what used to be Canada until the bombs fell. Their entire neighbourhood was destroyed and many died. Bombs rained down from above and turned their city to rubble. The Cowboy crawled out of the ruins of his house and searched for survivors, for someone to help him. Who he found was his neighbour, a boy the same age as him badly burned. His hair had turned a silverish white and he was barely clinging to life. The Cowboy nursed him back to health and they spent their days training, learning to fight and to use the abilities their bodies had somehow evolved into achieving. Their bodies had evolved past a normal human’s abilities in order to survive. One day, they made a vow to one another, it was the idea of human identity that had started the war and they decided to contradict the entire concept. They decided to never use the names given to them by the world, for it was an identity uncertainty that brought the war upon humanity; and on that day two men were born. The Northern Cowboy and The Midnight Gladiator were brought into existence and they were going to stop the war that took so much from them.

Back to the battle, The two men waited for a pause in the gunfire. When the bullet rain stopped they leapt out onto the battlefield and unleashed hell onto the armies; the Cowboy was a blur in the fight, he cast massive blue bolts of lightning towards the enemy and with each blast he made massive craters and sent men flying. The Gladiator conjured a tsunami of flames and sent it towards the army behind them. Within minutes the armies had stood down and retreated, The Cowboy spoke to his brother, “I'm gonna go get a ship, I’ll be back in a bit” “Alright get back fast though, I don’t wanna be stranded here with my pants down” his brother responded.

The Cowboy finally found a ship, a black two man fighter with a hand painted white stripe on it from the nose to the tail. He hopped in and flew back towards his comrade. However, what he saw was a terrible sight indeed. Both armies had returned with reinforcements and were unloading all they had onto his brother and he was just barely holding his own. He was dying in a blaze of glory, tornadoes of fire and beams of flame were shooting all throughout the battlefield, he was shouting and giving it his all, killing by the hundreds. The Cowboy knew that his brother would be a dead man and there was nothing he could do; he turned his ship around to leave with a heavy heart when the Gladiator spotted him in the sky about to leave. “DON’T GO! NO PLEASE! DON'T LEAVE ME HERE TO DIE! COWBOY! COME BACK!” The Gladiator roared and begged but the Cowboy knew better; with great sorrow in his heart he left his brother there on the battlefield for there was nothing he could hope to accomplish. The feeling in the Gladiator’s heart of betrayal turned to rage as he roared and screamed “YOU BETRAYED ME! HOW DARE YOU, WE ARE BROTHERS! DIE, YOU UNFAITHFUL BASTARD!” He turned towards the Cowboy’s vessel and unleashed a blaze so incredible it incinerated the battlefield for miles and he shot it right into the sky at his brother’s ship. The ship was engulfed in a pillar of flame; and as it plummeted towards the ground, The Cowboy caught a glimpse of his brother lying on the ground, in the charred dirt exhausted of all power and with many bullet wounds all over. The ship slammed into the earth and was somehow still intact.

A few hours later, the Cowboy was sitting in the wreckage of his ship when a star cruiser flew over head and landed nearby. Out of the ships loudspeaker a voice shouted, “Hey you’re the Cowboy right?” “Yeah who’s this?” the Cowboy shouted back. The voice spoke once again “It's Stripes, the hero from the States. Looks like you wanna get off this rock, hop in kid”.

**9**

**Present Day**

The Cowboy reboarded his vessel and Stripes took off, leaving their old home behind once again. “Hey that guy sure was a runner huh kid?” Stripes struck up a conversation, “Yeah, I’ve never seen a bounty run so damn fast in my life. He really did NOT want to go to jail, he must of pissed off someone inside” The Cowboy said back. “Ha! Yeah, better keep a strong hold on the soap pal” The two shared a good laugh as comrades one last time. The Cowboy knew the end was near for him and Stripes had probably figured so too. The visions had never been wrong, Futurado Gorge was a mystical place and somehow always seemed to predict correctly. The two men shared great comradery but even still, there was a melancholy feeling hanging in the air.

An urgent message flashed across the ship’s display, a message from the Solar Police Force.

It read, “ATTENTION! THIS VESSEL IS THE NEAREST REGISTERED HERO SHIP IN THE VICINITY OF THE INCIDENT, THE SYNDICATE OF THE BLUE MOON ARE LOOKING FOR A  CERTAIN BOUNTY HUNTER AND ARE KILLING POLICE AND CITIZENS UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THEM INFORMATION ON THE CONTRACT THAT THEY FOLLOWED, PLEASE RESPOND TO THE SITUATION AND ACT AS REINFORCEMENTS.”

“Stripes where is the location on that message?” The Cowboy asked, “Mercury Bridge” his partner replied. “Open the hanger, Stripes”

**10**

“You can’t be serious! You know what will happen Cowboy, Don't even think about it!” Stripes shouted at his partner. “Look man, someone’s gotta do something and I’ve got something to atone for. I’ve gotta be a hero one last time.” Stripes was upset but he knew there was no stopping his partner. Whatever happened on Earth that day was eating away at the Cowboy, he simply couldn’t take it anymore he had to make up for it or die trying and that was exactly what he was going to do. The Cowboy ran off to the hangar and hopped into his ship. The hangar doors opened and he sped off into the direction of Mercury.

The Cowboy was pondering to himself as he flew, “So this is probably the end huh? It’s okay, I’ve got to do this. I’ll do it for you brother, I’m sorry it had to end that way.” As he grew nearer to the planet, Stripes’ heart sank more and more; his partner would most certainly meet his demise. As skilled as the Cowboy was, he couldn’t take on the entire Syndicate. Not even in his prime, but he could certainly do some damage and help out. The Cowboy saw the gray planet grow closer and closer; he spotted the bridge floating in its orbit, connecting different parts of the planet to each other. He then spotted the masses of criminals and gangsters shooting civilians and police. He then decided to dive bomb his ship into the crowd of gangsters and do some real damage. He dove out and used the slower gravity to land slowly onto the bridge, his ship gained speed and crashed into the crowd with a massive explosion. The Cowboy leapt into action holding nothing back, he was firing his pistol into men and electrocuting others; he shot about 20 thugs and dropped the gun, then continued to fight with his bare hands and ability, taking fire from all sides he was still able to fight back. He was dodging and weaving in and out of the path of fire, landing punches and kicks covered in lightning on anyone in his way; his power surged through him, every move he made was as fast as lightning and as powerful as a thunderstorm. He slowed down for a minute to breathe when a bullet caught him in the back, “Arghh!” he groaned in pain, and stumbled but he kept on fighting regardless.

Stripes watched on in awe and horror, his partner was an amazing sight. The Cowboy let the power flow through him and he had an aura of lightning covering every inch of him, he battled his way through a crowd of criminals and finally broke out of the pack of gangsters. What was waiting for him was something he’d never expect as long as he’d live. The Cowboy collapsed to his knees and looked up, standing before him was his brother. The Midnight Gladiator was waiting for him; he looked different from the last time the Cowboy saw him, his face was burned and scarred, he had the look of an animal in his eyes. “Pathetic, just pathetic, brother. You’re simply a beast who’s lost his fangs” The Gladiator motioned for his men to stand down and continued to speak. “I got off that fucking rock and built an empire, you went and caught small fry bounties, you don’t even compare. If you’re gonna leave me for dead, at least do something with your life.”

The Cowboy was shattered. Not only was his brother trying to kill him, he became the very thing they swore against; he had become a tyrant, a warlord, a monster. He spoke to his long lost brother, “I didn’t want to leave you there, I just couldn’t do anything. You would’ve done the same” “NO! I WOULDN'T'VE! I WOULD HAVE DIED TRYING!” The Gladiator roared at his brother. The Cowboy had a realization in that moment, it was the realization that his brother always had a dark side; he was brutal, lethal and lusted for blood. Not unlike the way he fought in the war but the only difference now was that it had consumed him completely. The Gladiator’s hand erupted with flame and he swung down on The Cowboy to finish the job. The Cowboy looked up at his brother, the whole moment was seemingly slowed down in time, he reacted. The hero leapt back and got to his feet and countered, just as his brother hit the ground, shattering the asphalt. The Cowboy landed a flying kick directly into his face. The Gladiator was sent sprawling out to the ground and then got back to his feet angrier than ever. He unleashed a wave of flame towards his brother and The Cowboy sent a bolt of lightning right back at him, the attacks clashed mid-air and made an incredible shock wave all throughout the bridge. “Done with the warm up?” The Cowboy taunted, “Yeah let’s get serious” the Gladiator growled back at him. Both men were engulfed in their respective power, The Gladiator was now wearing an intimidating coating of flame and The Cowboy had a magnificent aura of lightning. The two men leapt at each other, clashing fists and kicks; with every blow, held the power of an earthquake, flames and electricity were shooting off of every bit of contact with the two.

They stumbled back after a few minutes of continuous fighting, they both took a breather and prepared to go at it once again. The two were equals, yet polar opposites. All the men surrounding them were in awe and dared not get involved; their leader was showing power of which they’d never seen and this complete stranger to them was not only keeping up, but holding his own.

The two charged once again and met in the middle of Mercury Bridge, The Gladiator reared back onto one foot and brought his other leg down in a heel kick from above onto The Cowboy. The Cowboy raised his arms to block the attack and the force of it drove him right into the ground, right through the pavement. The biodome surrounding Mercury and it's bridge to make it habitable was shaking; every single man on the bridge, even the most seasoned gangster was fearful for their lives. The Cowboy leapt out of the shattered asphalt and landed a fierce upper cut on his brother which sent him flying into the air and then he too, hit the ground damn hard. The Gladiator unleashed everything he had in him, every ounce of power, every drop of energy he had was now barreling towards The Cowboy. Our Hero didn’t dodge, he stood still facing his brother barreling towards him. He allowed his brother’s flame covered fist to pierce right through his stomach. He didn’t even flinch, his lightning aura disappeared and his brother’s flames fizzled out. “I'm sorry brother.” The Cowboy whispered to his opponent. The Cowboy put his hand right over the Gladiator’s heart and said “Come with me.” He used the last power he had left in his wounded body and sent a shock right into the Gladiator’s heart, stopping it entirely. The Gladiator’s eyes widened and then closed. He whispered to the Cowboy with a smile as he died, “Oh good, you’ve got your fangs back…” then slumped over backwards as the last of his life drained out of him. The Cowboy fell to his knees and called back to the Star Horse, “Stripes, I’m a dead man. There’s nothing you could’ve done for me, don’t fret my friend. I left you something..” he continued, “Use the cameras and look in the weapon storage in the hangar.” Stripes tuned the cameras to the hangar and he saw a tank full of liquid with a body in it. “What is it?” Stripes asked confused. “It’s a replica of your old body, powers and all. I had it made the night after I saw the vision of my death, I spent all my bounty money and savings on it for ya.” The Cowboy kept talking, “All you need to do is activate the control panel remotely, and turn on the A.I. transfer to the body.” The Cowboy’s last message was a simple one, “I’m gonna go to sleep now, Stripes. Easy Come, Easy Go, Mijo” Stripes was now in his new body and stepped out of the tank. A tear rolled down his face as he radioed back to his partner, “See you, Cowboy”.

The Cowboy leaned back and looked out of the side of the bridge, the sun was in plain view as he died. He stared at the ball of beautiful, burning gasses. As the light faded away from him, he spoke his last breath, “Hell makes brothers of us all…”

**Afterword**

Hi There Dear Reader! My name’s Tim Agar and I hoped you enjoyed coming with me on this incredible journey of mine. My inspirations for this story came partly from *Cowboy Bebop* and from movies like *Platoon* and *The Good, Bad and The Ugly*, I have always loved westerns and sci-fi and it was a blast to combine them and pay homage to the great pieces of fiction that have inspired me. My experience writing this was one of the best of my life and I appreciate any attention this tale gets. Thank you for sticking around to the end and I bid you farewell.

***Easy Come, Easy Go...***","""Easy Come, Easy Go..."" A Sci FI short story The year was 2268. Humanity had stretched throughout the reaches of our own solar system and beyond. We were now a united species, one nation exploring the cosmos under a single name: “human race”. The Earth still remains, as well as many other planets in our solar system, the only difference is that back then... they were inhabited. Planet and space travel was simply like a bus route with destinations throughout the stars.

**1**

A man awoke in his star cruiser with a startled jolt upright, followed by his own hyperventilating. A voice spoke from the shadows, “Did ya have another one pal?” “Shut Up, Stripes” the man responds. The voice chided him, “Listen Kid, that day was fuckin’ ages ago. Let Go”. The man before you’s real name is unknown. However, he is better known as “The Northern Cowboy” throughout Earth and neighbouring planets. Now you see, The Cowboy was a hero to the people of Earth. That voice in the back, the man known as Stripes was a hero as well, or he was until he lost his entire physical body in the biggest battle in human history.

The society in this time may been advanced one, but it still has its conflicts. Now, one of these conflicts made these men heroes, The Battle for Humanity was the largest battle in human history. The entire species divided, two massive armies lead by two political groups went head to head. The Planetarian group; a party that believes the population should merge and become one nationality to be recognized as human. Then, there's the Individuals, people wanting the borders to remain on our planet and to preserve cultures. The decision for the dominant party wasn’t one to be made in a courtroom, no one could decide on a party to put in charge. The dominant half needed to rise. Was it time for drastic change? Or was it time to preserve? That is what this fight would’ve decided.

The two armies clashed all over the solar system and fought for 12 whole years in continuous battle. Now this fight never ended, it was stopped. Stopped by exactly 390 heroes, two men or women from each country on Earth stood tall and decided to rally and stop this war. This was seen as an impossible feat for any normal human, but these people weren’t normal, they were extraordinary. They possessed abilities and powers only a fraction of the human race had. Some people were born with their abilities, like it was the next step of human evolution, others acquired them through science or an altering incident of some sort; these people were like folklore of their home countries, mere myths. However, the myths soon became reality when these people aligned with one another. Using their abilities, they arrived in the middle of the front lines of every battle between both armies and held them off. Eventually, these armies stopped their clash and listened to what these heroes had to say. These incredible men and women were seen as gods among mortals, and the leaders of both sides decided that if these people found a way to stop the fight and bring the society together, it would be worth listening to and trying. Soon after the war ended, a united party was formed and governed all of humanity. The Planet Earth Society was formed; a society that kept our individualities present on Earth, but we explored the cosmos and functioned our government as one species.

Now, back to our two heroes. The Northern Cowboy was a hero out of Canada, and Stripes was his partner out of the states. These men had some extremely powerful abilities; Stripes, a once massively built man, had the power to control electronics and machines with his mind, and The Cowboy, a tall man who stood at about 6’1 with two different coloured eyes, one black and one blue, had the ability to generate and manipulate lightning out of his body. All heroes were as strong as this, if not more. So obviously, it was no wonder they were able to stop the imminent war. However, the victory didn't come without its share of sacrifices. Stripes was gunned down between the two armies. A seasoned war vet like himself couldn’t avoid his own demise at the age of 42. But as a last act of desperation, he transferred his consciousness into the computer in the Star Horse, their ship; Immortalizing himself into his own starcruiser. Now, The Cowboy had his own tragedies as well, involving the death of the other Canadian hero... but we’ll get to that later.

“Where are we Stripes?” the Cowboy asked groggily, “About 300 miles away from the Red Dust Casino, in the Mars Orbit.” Every planet with a ground to stand on had been terraformed so that it was habitable for humans, and Mars was like the Las Vegas of the solar system, a planet for the rich and famous. “Are we making a pitstop, kid?” Stripes asked. The Man nodded, “Yeah but this ain’t for pleasure, we’ve got business to attend to at the Red Dust Grand Hotel”. Stripes replied, “Alright Cowboy I’ll bring us down for a landing-” The Cowboy interrupted, “Hold it, stop over top of the Crimson Canyon, I’ve got something to do first. Open the hanger for me would ya?” After a morning cigarette and a shot of whisky for breakfast, The Northern Cowboy boarded his one man fighter; a black, modified advanced secret service ship with a hand-painted white stripe down the middle. On the side of the fighter was a name painted in red, it read “Le Pew”. The Cowboy fired up his engines and shot out of the ship, and right into the depths of the canyon.

The canyon The Cowboy had just ventured into was a place named Futurado Gorge. This canyon had a reputation all around the star system of being a dangerous death trap that only fools would venture into. So knowing this, Stripes questioned his partner's motives and speaks over the comm, “Hey Kid what the hell are ya doin’ divin’ into a place like this?” He responds, “Don't worry about it Stripes I know what I'm doing”, “alright whatever kid”. The Cowboy had discovered a while back that the water in this cave had unusual properties to it; the water allowed the person who touched it to see parts of their future, so being the clever guy that he is, he uses it to his advantages sometimes. When the Cowboy reached the bottom of the gorge, he got out of his ship and knelt down and touched the water…

The Cowboy’s eyes lit up for a moment and then he saw his entire life flash before his eyes, and then the vision showed itself to him, he sat back, shook his hands dry, and lit a cigarette. After a few minutes of pondering, he stood up and shrugged. He spoke to himself, “So that's how I go, huh? It's a bit sooner than I would’ve thought. Oh well, guess it can’t be helped” He threw his cigarette into the water and got back into his ship.

**2**

On the top floor of the Red Dust Casino, there’s a meeting between two men. One man is a criminal who runs the Casino and uses it for a drug and money laundering scheme to supply dealers throughout the solar system. His name is Isaac Pantangellini, an average height man but powerfully built nonetheless, he had tanned skin with jet black hair slicked back into a mullet. The other man was a short and unhealthily thin young man called Mouse, with matted brown hair and sharp facial features; he is a bright young man in the drug business; but it seems he’s bit off more than he can chew with his most recent scam.

Pantangellini started his rant towards Mouse by puffing his own ego a bit. He speaks aggressively, “Look dipshit, you don’t know who you fucked with. I own this casino and the resort, I’m not the manager or the bouncer, I'm the OWNER. I'm also a man who doesn’t put up with nobody’s shit, I have half of all the Mars cops on my payroll and the other half knows they can’t screw with me, I OWN this town. So tell me this kid, WHAT IN THE NAME OF JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH DID YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU TRIED TO SCAM ME?!” Mouse responds with a cool ignorance towards the riled up mob boss, “To be honest, what I thought would happen is that I’d grab one of the cases of money you launder through this joint to cover your drug business, and then I’d escape and you’d never see me again. But ya know what? You can go eat Venus Baboon shit, you fogey, I don’t care if ya caught me” Pantangellini was fuming mad from his disrespectful demeanor. He stood up from his desk, pulled a gun out of the holster concealed by his blazer, held it over Mouse’s head and brought the base of the gun onto the bridge of the kid’s nose so hard the cartilage in his face was smashed into oblivion and his cheekbones were shattered. Mouse crumpled to the floor after falling out of his chair. The casino boss pointed to his two henchmen at the door, “Hey you two, take this asswipe out back and put as many bullets as you want into the back of his head.” He then pointed to the blood on his marble floor and said, “Oh and get someone to clean this mess up.”

At that very moment, The Cowboy touched down into the casino’s ship lot and parked his vessel there and put on his red trench coat, “Are ya gonna pay for the valet service kid?” asked Stripes, “Fuck no, I’m not made of money pal” The Cowboy responded. “What happened to givin’ back to the community?” asked Stripes. His partner talks back through the comm, “We gave up that hero of the people stuff remember? We do this to get paid now” “Just givin’ ya hell kid, lighten up a bit would ya?” The Cowboy sighed and walked towards the back door of the casino; just as he approached the door, it was slammed open and out rushed two burly men in suits dragging a badly beaten, sickly looking young man who was unhealthily thin. The men passed the Cowboy. The ex-hero took a few more steps before stopping, cursing himself as he turned around to walk towards the men. The men had the beaten man on his knees with a gun to the back of his head. The Cowboy approached the men and obnoxiously asked, “Hey do any of you boys got a light?” One of the men turned on the stranger who had just approached him and pulled a gun on him, “Woah easy partner, I just need a light.” The Cowboy said passively. The man responds, “Piss off punk, or you're next”. The Cowboy continued to walk towards the thug, unfazed by the gun pointed in his direction. The thug fired. In a flash of blue light, the bullet seemed to miss its mark and then the thug was on the ground writhing in pain.

The Cowboy stood over the thug, stepped over his crumpled body and approached the second man. The second thug turned around and pulled his gun on the Cowboy. In a seemingly effortless motion the Cowboy had smashed the man's leg with a side kick and landed a knee to the man’s chest. The thug staggered for a minute and stood up again, firing away at the ex-hero. The Cowboy leapt out of the way of the bullets and snapped his fingers at the man and simply said “Bang”. Lightning shot out of the Cowboy’s hand and sent the thug flying a good 100 yards away. The Cowboy turned and walked away, lighting a cigarette. He looked over his shoulder and said to the beaten man, “Get to a hospital yourself, I’m not your fuckin’ babysitter”

The Cowboy sat at the casino bar and took a look around the place, a lively venue with a gold color pallette on seemingly every surface. The place was filled with people all dressed up in tuxedos and fancy silk dresses surrounding gambling tables and blackjack pits. The barmaid took a look at the Cowboy and was intrigued, he didn’t look the part of a gambler, he wore a casual, but wrinkled, black suit with a white shirt and black tie, and a faded red trench coat overtop. She walked over to him at the end of the bar and started talking “Howdy stranger, what corner of the stars did you wander in from?” He calmly replies, “Oh a place a lot worse than this one, can you get me an Old Fashioned?” She made him the drink and placed it in front of him, he knocked it back in a couple long gulps and then asked, “Do you know how to get to the top floor? I’ve got to have a chat with the man who runs this joint” She was less interested in the man now, “Oh he’s just another drug dealer here to see the guy upstairs” she thought. She then asked him “Here to close a deal?” “No sweetheart I'm here for him” he replied as he pointed upwards. She then asked,”A hitman?” The Cowboy replied, “Not quite, thanks for the drink” and got up and left without paying. He only left a bullet, sliced in half and scorched, on his napkin.

The first floor service elevator doors were always locked in the casino, it was the way to get up to the top floor office where Pantangellini hid out. The Cowboy walked up to the doors and pried them open and opened the top hatch in the elevator. He then used his lightning to charge the cable and the elevator shot upwards, he stopped it when it got to the top, he composed himself for a moment and blasted the doors open. The men in the office were startled by the massive explosion coming from the elevator and the doors shattering, which followed the initial bang. Out stepped the Cowboy, through a cloud of dust coming from the door. “Hey your elevator kinda sucks, the doors wouldn’t open” he said cooly. All the men in the room, including Pantangellini  pulled their guns and fired into the dust and at the man that stood before them. The Cowboy walked backwards into the dust in the midst of the gunfire. After a minute or two of continuous fire, Pantangellini was shoved from behind. Everyone turned around shocked, to see the Cowboy behind the men, he had moved so fast no one had seen him get behind them. The Cowboy took Pantangellini’s gun from his hands with a quick jerk, and fired into all the men’s shoulders and knees; except for the mob boss who was now shaking in fear.

The Ex-hero kneeled down and was face to face with the criminal. He spoke, “You’re worth a fat $300 000 bounty Pantangellini. It seems like the all cops weren’t under your control, and that bounty’s all mine” Pantangellini was somewhat relieved he wasn’t going to be killed. He had to be brought in alive. “Stripes call the cops to the top floor, I’m not bringing him to ‘em” he said over his comm. “Alright Cowboy” his partner responds. The mob boss on the floor, who had now soiled himself, spoke with some confidence now that he knew he wasn’t going to be shot. He looked up at the man who had just brought him down and spoke, “You’re a filthy fuckin’ bounty hunter, you won’t last a week! You hear! YOU’RE DEAD! WHO ARE YOU?!” As if it was scripted, the Cowboy lights a cigarette and says in his trademark nonchalant tone, “Who me? Well, I’m just an old fashioned cowboy”.

On the other side of the asteroid belt orbiting Titan, one of Saturn’s moons, there was a large cruiser. The cruiser was owned by the Syndicate Of The Blue Moon, the largest crime organization in the solar system. The Syndicate was the unofficial ruler of the criminal underworld, they had immense power and resources; that of which rivaled the government. These people were no joke and certainly nothing to be taken lightly, their leader was a cruel and powerful man with incredible abilities. His name, The Midnight Gladiator. He could control and generate fire, giving him the ability to conjure immense blazes and destroy anything in his path. The Gladiator stood at a solid six feet tall, he wore a black suit and pants, with a scarred face and a head of white hair, despite him actually being quite young. He was a  truly frightening man, who showed no mercy to anyone.

The Gladiator sat on a throne in the main chamber of his vessel with a man whimpering on the floor before him. The man begged for his life, “No please, I am so, so utterly sorry. You will have my undying loyalty if you let this go, please stop. Spare me! S-spare me, let me live!” The man stammered on, sniveling on the floor as he begged. The Gladiator grew impatient, “SHUT UP!” he roared. He approached the man and grabbed his face by his chin and spoke directly to the man, “I don’t accept failure, that package needed to get there. You have failed, you are worthless to me now. I have no use for you.” The Gladiator covered the man’s face with his hand, which grew hotter and hotter as his grip tightened. Soon a blaze erupted out of his hand and the man’s head was incinerated into ashes, the screaming died out as his headless body fell to the floor. Two men in suits rushed over and started to drag the body away. There was a knock at the door to the main chamber and a man with glasses who had a rather weak demeanor, donning a bland brown suit, walked in.

“What is it Genco?” The Gladiator asked. “It's Pantangellini” he said, nervously adding “He got life inside, a bounty hunter got ‘em’” The man of flame was concerned, “Well shit, there goes our best money launderer, we’ve gotta get a new casino” he continued “Genco, who was the bounty hunter that nailed him?” In a weak tone, Genco spoke to his boss, “We didn’t get a name, all Pantangellini said was that the man just told him he was a cowboy.” The Gladiator’s attention spiked, “What did you just say?!” He demanded. A bit frightened now, Genco spoke again “Um… He’s a cowboy sir, that’s all we know, is that alright? Did I do something wrong?” Genco was shaking now, and his stutter started acting up after seeing the burned up body laying on the floor. In a few words, he was fearful for his own life.

“Leave me, and deal with that corpse, you have two minutes.” “Y-yes sir!” Genco ran off dragging the body with the men, all while dry-heaving from the smell of burnt flesh. The Gladiator turned and looked out his window and contemplated what he had just discovered. “The bastard’s still alive! How?! There was no way he could’ve made it out all those years ago.” His mind was racing, The Northern Cowboy was still alive!

**5**

When the Cowboy arrived back on the ship he transferred Stripes his 10% cut of the job. Now you see, Stripes had no need for money; he wasn’t an actual person anymore. He was essentially an A.I. program at this point; the man was immortal now, his consciousness would live on forever. He was just in it for something to do, so a big cut wasn’t really needed for him. Stripes was a curious man and something had been on his mind for a while now, “Hey partner, what did ya see down in that cave the other day?” The Cowboy looked up from the gun he stole on Mars, which he was cleaning, and said simply, “I saw myself die. I died on my knees, burned and beaten. Right on Mercury Bridge, overlooking the sun.” Stripes was surprised, “No shit huh, were you old or what?” “Nope, in fact I looked the same as I am now” Stripes was worried for his partner, he knew the Cowboy would never run from death; he had no fear of it. His fearlessness wasn’t made of bravery, it was something darker.

The man you know as “The Cowboy” is a very peculiar man. He has no fear of anything, he has no cares in the world, he just lives. Day in and day out he is just living for the sake of living. He had a brush with death. He made a grave mistake one day, and ended up looking death in the face and it stole something from him, the ability to care had been stolen from the man. In his eyes, he lived by one belief; “Easy Come, Easy Go”. He is a man who is attached to nothing, he saw no point in getting attached to something if he was just going to die at the end and lose it all, just like it did that fateful day, the day that still haunts him when he sleeps; The day that will never leave him. He welcomes death, he just waits for it to come around the corner and claim him. He’s lost his ability to care, for it was snatched from him by death itself; and every night, he relives the encounter. A man sentenced to psychological torture daily, for as long as he lives, sort of a parting gift from death.

Stripes’ concern grew, he knew for a fact that the Cowboy wouldn’t avoid his own demise; he knew that the Cowboy would face it without a second thought. Stripes didn’t want to lose his brother in arms, “Hey kid, you might wanna avoid Mercury Bridge then eh?” The Cowboy holsters the pistol he stole from the Mob Boss on Mars and spoke, “Meh, I don’t really care, we’ll see what happens I guess”. Stripes, a once strong man, also had no purpose now. He was simply a spirit destined to float through the cosmos for eternity; for his consciousness was immortal, he would always be alive. Now, the thing he valued most, were his comrades. The Cowboy was like a kid brother to him, the only thing tethering him to reality was his only friend.

On the other side of the solar system approaching the asteroid belt, was a fleet the size 200 or so starships. The Syndicate Of The Blue Moon was heading straight for Mars. The Gladiator was looking for someone to answer for his missing money launderer and he was bringing his entire fleet. Pantangellini was a huge part of the money the Gladiator had, he made it clean to use by running it through his casino. It was virtually untraceable by the government; and now it was gone. Taken by some bounty hunter looking for a paycheck.

Now the important thing to remember is that this time period is just as lawless as it is advanced. The solar system may have had government and society, but the underworld of crime was just as large. The two worlds only meet when it comes to one thing, Bounties. The government sometimes wants a certain person and doesn’t want to waste police manpower; with a whole solar system to cover, they need all the help they can get. So the government enlists the help of people looking to make a quick buck. There are two types of bounties, an open contract: where anyone can go and get the target; or a private contract: where a specific person/group gets a contract exclusive to them. The Pantangellini contract was a private one; since Stripes was well known from his days as a hero and from his incredible skill, he gets clearance for high profile/dangerous people the cops want. Therefore, him getting a contract for someone like the casino owning/money launderer wasn’t out of the ordinary; but the fact that he got the Gladiator’s money launderer was some insane coincidence and bad luck for the crime boss.

One thing to mention was that the Gladiator was absolutely livid. He despised bounty hunters in general and the fact that one had gotten one of his most useful assets drove him crazy; on top of that, the man who stole it from him was the person he hated most. The hate was spawned for a reason only known between the two men, and the Gladiator had thought he’d gotten his revenge on the Cowboy and finished him off years ago. However, as both you and I know, the Cowboy is very much alive.

“GENCO!” The man turned a pale shade of grey, “Y-y-yes sir?” Genco stammered in response to the Gladiator. “Find a ship called the Star Horse! I WANT IT FOUND! Spend as much as you need, just get me that ship!” The Gladiator finished his yelling fit towards his assistant and sat down on his throne with a look of death on his face; for he was out for blood and he was going to get it.

**7**

“Well shit, ain’t that a sight huh Stripes?” The Cowboy asked. “Ha, it sure has been a while. What’s it been, five years?” His partner responded. The Star Horse was orbiting the once blue and green planet of Earth. The War had destroyed pretty much all wildlife on the planet, all the forests had cities and skyscrapers built out of the ashes of a once prospering planet. So naturally, the planet had been turned into a blue and grey coloured rock orbiting the sun. Even if it wasn’t the prettiest sight ever, it was their home.

The Cowboy perked up and spoke, “Woah, hey easy Stripes, you haven’t gotten clearance to land yet” Stripes was distracted and seemed distant, even for a non-physical being. “Ah shit my bad, calling in now.” Stripes sent out his ID and got a spot on a landing strip near the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Stripes was having himself some bittersweet nostalgia, the last time he was here on Earth, he lost so much to him. That’s right, the battle when Stripes was confined to his ship forever, were his last moments on Earth. The same went for The Cowboy, he hadn’t returned to the planet since that fateful day either.

The duo had returned to Earth to grab a quick bounty and then get out. To The Cowboy, the faster he could leave, the better. This was mainly because the whole solar system thought he was a dead man who died in the final battle on Earth, who died a hero (they made a plaque for him and everything). It was perfect for him, he hated the whole hero gig; he liked to operate freely and do things he wanted, whenever he wanted. So naturally, the hero committee that was formed put restrictions on how you could act and he hated it; so he never was a huge hero of the people, no one really knew him, he was just a guy who could fight really damn well and he happened to do it for good. So as The Cowboy walked into the setting sun to grab his bounty under the cover of nightfall, he remembered the simpler days…

**2263, Earth, Five Years Prior To Present Day**

Gunfire rained down from above, the varying volume of bombs crashing down indicated their distance from them, screams of the souls lost from the war echoed in the distance. There these two men stood, bullets whizzing around them and above their heads as they stood in their trench. The two men went by names familiar to us both, The Northern Cowboy and The Midnight Gladiator. “They say hell makes two men brothers through the despair they share” said the Gladiator to his comrade. “I guess it does but we were brothers before we got into the fight” The Cowboy responded. The two men were polar opposites, The Gladiator was a fierce warrior who lusted for bloodshed and power; meanwhile, his brother The Cowboy was a cool and collected man who didn’t care much for the war they were fighting. But they were brothers nonetheless; now you see, they weren’t brothers by blood, but by situation.

12 Years ago when the war between humanity began, both men were mere children who had lost their families in the crossfires of the war. At just 11 years old, The Cowboy and The Gladiator were neighbours in what used to be Canada until the bombs fell. Their entire neighbourhood was destroyed and many died. Bombs rained down from above and turned their city to rubble. The Cowboy crawled out of the ruins of his house and searched for survivors, for someone to help him. Who he found was his neighbour, a boy the same age as him badly burned. His hair had turned a silverish white and he was barely clinging to life. The Cowboy nursed him back to health and they spent their days training, learning to fight and to use the abilities their bodies had somehow evolved into achieving. Their bodies had evolved past a normal human’s abilities in order to survive. One day, they made a vow to one another, it was the idea of human identity that had started the war and they decided to contradict the entire concept. They decided to never use the names given to them by the world, for it was an identity uncertainty that brought the war upon humanity; and on that day two men were born. The Northern Cowboy and The Midnight Gladiator were brought into existence and they were going to stop the war that took so much from them.

Back to the battle, The two men waited for a pause in the gunfire. When the bullet rain stopped they leapt out onto the battlefield and unleashed hell onto the armies; the Cowboy was a blur in the fight, he cast massive blue bolts of lightning towards the enemy and with each blast he made massive craters and sent men flying. The Gladiator conjured a tsunami of flames and sent it towards the army behind them. Within minutes the armies had stood down and retreated, The Cowboy spoke to his brother, “I'm gonna go get a ship, I’ll be back in a bit” “Alright get back fast though, I don’t wanna be stranded here with my pants down” his brother responded.

The Cowboy finally found a ship, a black two man fighter with a hand painted white stripe on it from the nose to the tail. He hopped in and flew back towards his comrade. However, what he saw was a terrible sight indeed. Both armies had returned with reinforcements and were unloading all they had onto his brother and he was just barely holding his own. He was dying in a blaze of glory, tornadoes of fire and beams of flame were shooting all throughout the battlefield, he was shouting and giving it his all, killing by the hundreds. The Cowboy knew that his brother would be a dead man and there was nothing he could do; he turned his ship around to leave with a heavy heart when the Gladiator spotted him in the sky about to leave. “DON’T GO! NO PLEASE! DON'T LEAVE ME HERE TO DIE! COWBOY! COME BACK!” The Gladiator roared and begged but the Cowboy knew better; with great sorrow in his heart he left his brother there on the battlefield for there was nothing he could hope to accomplish. The feeling in the Gladiator’s heart of betrayal turned to rage as he roared and screamed “YOU BETRAYED ME! HOW DARE YOU, WE ARE BROTHERS! DIE, YOU UNFAITHFUL BASTARD!” He turned towards the Cowboy’s vessel and unleashed a blaze so incredible it incinerated the battlefield for miles and he shot it right into the sky at his brother’s ship. The ship was engulfed in a pillar of flame; and as it plummeted towards the ground, The Cowboy caught a glimpse of his brother lying on the ground, in the charred dirt exhausted of all power and with many bullet wounds all over. The ship slammed into the earth and was somehow still intact.

A few hours later, the Cowboy was sitting in the wreckage of his ship when a star cruiser flew over head and landed nearby. Out of the ships loudspeaker a voice shouted, “Hey you’re the Cowboy right?” “Yeah who’s this?” the Cowboy shouted back. The voice spoke once again “It's Stripes, the hero from the States. Looks like you wanna get off this rock, hop in kid”.

**9**

**Present Day**

The Cowboy reboarded his vessel and Stripes took off, leaving their old home behind once again. “Hey that guy sure was a runner huh kid?” Stripes struck up a conversation, “Yeah, I’ve never seen a bounty run so damn fast in my life. He really did NOT want to go to jail, he must of pissed off someone inside” The Cowboy said back. “Ha! Yeah, better keep a strong hold on the soap pal” The two shared a good laugh as comrades one last time. The Cowboy knew the end was near for him and Stripes had probably figured so too. The visions had never been wrong, Futurado Gorge was a mystical place and somehow always seemed to predict correctly. The two men shared great comradery but even still, there was a melancholy feeling hanging in the air.

An urgent message flashed across the ship’s display, a message from the Solar Police Force.

It read, “ATTENTION! THIS VESSEL IS THE NEAREST REGISTERED HERO SHIP IN THE VICINITY OF THE INCIDENT, THE SYNDICATE OF THE BLUE MOON ARE LOOKING FOR A  CERTAIN BOUNTY HUNTER AND ARE KILLING POLICE AND CITIZENS UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GIVES THEM INFORMATION ON THE CONTRACT THAT THEY FOLLOWED, PLEASE RESPOND TO THE SITUATION AND ACT AS REINFORCEMENTS.”

“Stripes where is the location on that message?” The Cowboy asked, “Mercury Bridge” his partner replied. “Open the hanger, Stripes”

**10**

“You can’t be serious! You know what will happen Cowboy, Don't even think about it!” Stripes shouted at his partner. “Look man, someone’s gotta do something and I’ve got something to atone for. I’ve gotta be a hero one last time.” Stripes was upset but he knew there was no stopping his partner. Whatever happened on Earth that day was eating away at the Cowboy, he simply couldn’t take it anymore he had to make up for it or die trying and that was exactly what he was going to do. The Cowboy ran off to the hangar and hopped into his ship. The hangar doors opened and he sped off into the direction of Mercury.

The Cowboy was pondering to himself as he flew, “So this is probably the end huh? It’s okay, I’ve got to do this. I’ll do it for you brother, I’m sorry it had to end that way.” As he grew nearer to the planet, Stripes’ heart sank more and more; his partner would most certainly meet his demise. As skilled as the Cowboy was, he couldn’t take on the entire Syndicate. Not even in his prime, but he could certainly do some damage and help out. The Cowboy saw the gray planet grow closer and closer; he spotted the bridge floating in its orbit, connecting different parts of the planet to each other. He then spotted the masses of criminals and gangsters shooting civilians and police. He then decided to dive bomb his ship into the crowd of gangsters and do some real damage. He dove out and used the slower gravity to land slowly onto the bridge, his ship gained speed and crashed into the crowd with a massive explosion. The Cowboy leapt into action holding nothing back, he was firing his pistol into men and electrocuting others; he shot about 20 thugs and dropped the gun, then continued to fight with his bare hands and ability, taking fire from all sides he was still able to fight back. He was dodging and weaving in and out of the path of fire, landing punches and kicks covered in lightning on anyone in his way; his power surged through him, every move he made was as fast as lightning and as powerful as a thunderstorm. He slowed down for a minute to breathe when a bullet caught him in the back, “Arghh!” he groaned in pain, and stumbled but he kept on fighting regardless.

Stripes watched on in awe and horror, his partner was an amazing sight. The Cowboy let the power flow through him and he had an aura of lightning covering every inch of him, he battled his way through a crowd of criminals and finally broke out of the pack of gangsters. What was waiting for him was something he’d never expect as long as he’d live. The Cowboy collapsed to his knees and looked up, standing before him was his brother. The Midnight Gladiator was waiting for him; he looked different from the last time the Cowboy saw him, his face was burned and scarred, he had the look of an animal in his eyes. “Pathetic, just pathetic, brother. You’re simply a beast who’s lost his fangs” The Gladiator motioned for his men to stand down and continued to speak. “I got off that fucking rock and built an empire, you went and caught small fry bounties, you don’t even compare. If you’re gonna leave me for dead, at least do something with your life.”

The Cowboy was shattered. Not only was his brother trying to kill him, he became the very thing they swore against; he had become a tyrant, a warlord, a monster. He spoke to his long lost brother, “I didn’t want to leave you there, I just couldn’t do anything. You would’ve done the same” “NO! I WOULDN'T'VE! I WOULD HAVE DIED TRYING!” The Gladiator roared at his brother. The Cowboy had a realization in that moment, it was the realization that his brother always had a dark side; he was brutal, lethal and lusted for blood. Not unlike the way he fought in the war but the only difference now was that it had consumed him completely. The Gladiator’s hand erupted with flame and he swung down on The Cowboy to finish the job. The Cowboy looked up at his brother, the whole moment was seemingly slowed down in time, he reacted. The hero leapt back and got to his feet and countered, just as his brother hit the ground, shattering the asphalt. The Cowboy landed a flying kick directly into his face. The Gladiator was sent sprawling out to the ground and then got back to his feet angrier than ever. He unleashed a wave of flame towards his brother and The Cowboy sent a bolt of lightning right back at him, the attacks clashed mid-air and made an incredible shock wave all throughout the bridge. “Done with the warm up?” The Cowboy taunted, “Yeah let’s get serious” the Gladiator growled back at him. Both men were engulfed in their respective power, The Gladiator was now wearing an intimidating coating of flame and The Cowboy had a magnificent aura of lightning. The two men leapt at each other, clashing fists and kicks; with every blow, held the power of an earthquake, flames and electricity were shooting off of every bit of contact with the two.

They stumbled back after a few minutes of continuous fighting, they both took a breather and prepared to go at it once again. The two were equals, yet polar opposites. All the men surrounding them were in awe and dared not get involved; their leader was showing power of which they’d never seen and this complete stranger to them was not only keeping up, but holding his own.

The two charged once again and met in the middle of Mercury Bridge, The Gladiator reared back onto one foot and brought his other leg down in a heel kick from above onto The Cowboy. The Cowboy raised his arms to block the attack and the force of it drove him right into the ground, right through the pavement. The biodome surrounding Mercury and it's bridge to make it habitable was shaking; every single man on the bridge, even the most seasoned gangster was fearful for their lives. The Cowboy leapt out of the shattered asphalt and landed a fierce upper cut on his brother which sent him flying into the air and then he too, hit the ground damn hard. The Gladiator unleashed everything he had in him, every ounce of power, every drop of energy he had was now barreling towards The Cowboy. Our Hero didn’t dodge, he stood still facing his brother barreling towards him. He allowed his brother’s flame covered fist to pierce right through his stomach. He didn’t even flinch, his lightning aura disappeared and his brother’s flames fizzled out. “I'm sorry brother.” The Cowboy whispered to his opponent. The Cowboy put his hand right over the Gladiator’s heart and said “Come with me.” He used the last power he had left in his wounded body and sent a shock right into the Gladiator’s heart, stopping it entirely. The Gladiator’s eyes widened and then closed. He whispered to the Cowboy with a smile as he died, “Oh good, you’ve got your fangs back…” then slumped over backwards as the last of his life drained out of him. The Cowboy fell to his knees and called back to the Star Horse, “Stripes, I’m a dead man. There’s nothing you could’ve done for me, don’t fret my friend. I left you something..” he continued, “Use the cameras and look in the weapon storage in the hangar.” Stripes tuned the cameras to the hangar and he saw a tank full of liquid with a body in it. “What is it?” Stripes asked confused. “It’s a replica of your old body, powers and all. I had it made the night after I saw the vision of my death, I spent all my bounty money and savings on it for ya.” The Cowboy kept talking, “All you need to do is activate the control panel remotely, and turn on the A.I. transfer to the body.” The Cowboy’s last message was a simple one, “I’m gonna go to sleep now, Stripes. Easy Come, Easy Go, Mijo” Stripes was now in his new body and stepped out of the tank. A tear rolled down his face as he radioed back to his partner, “See you, Cowboy”.

The Cowboy leaned back and looked out of the side of the bridge, the sun was in plain view as he died. He stared at the ball of beautiful, burning gasses. As the light faded away from him, he spoke his last breath, “Hell makes brothers of us all…”

**Afterword**

Hi There Dear Reader! My name’s Tim Agar and I hoped you enjoyed coming with me on this incredible journey of mine. My inspirations for this story came partly from *Cowboy Bebop* and from movies like *Platoon* and *The Good, Bad and The Ugly*, I have always loved westerns and sci-fi and it was a blast to combine them and pay homage to the great pieces of fiction that have inspired me. My experience writing this was one of the best of my life and I appreciate any attention this tale gets. Thank you for sticking around to the end and I bid you farewell.

"Another ""Three-Body Problem"" Thread","So I finished reading Liu Cixin's *Three Body Problem* a while back. To keep it brief, I loved it. Having the real-life Cultural Revolution be the backdrop for much of the story lent it some novelty for someone used to reading Western sci-fi, and the more or less realistic depiction of the life of scientists really grounded the characters and the plot. I also really enjoyed the terse, economic writing style which kept the pacing up nicely. All of the story threads were interesting and especially the mystery of the Three Body game was a great hook throughout. I ended up zipping through it in a few days. 

Starting to read its sequel, *The Dark Forest*, I already feel like something's changed. The writing style feels completely different, all the concision of the language is replaced with a slow, overly descriptive style. The fact that it's set so much in the future causes it to lose some of what gave the original it's charm by being an ""alternate history"". I'm having a trouble staying engaged so I'll probably come back to it later. Anyone else feel like the second book isn't as strong as the first?

Also any suggestions for other good, non-Western sci-fi? ","Another ""Three-Body Problem"" Thread So I finished reading Liu Cixin's *Three Body Problem* a while back. To keep it brief, I loved it.

I HAVE to talk about the Daedalus-Class...,"OK! I've recently gotten unhealthy into the Stargate franchise about 6 months ago, no sense then, i've found out so much, and have fallen in love with this franchise, and I have to talk about the Daedalus-Class BC-304 to stay sane.



First, I will discuss how I figured out the Daedalus-class, and my utter stupidity... Ok, when I was about 6 seasons into SG-1, I saw the BC-303 Prometheus, and I instantly fell in love with the ship, it reminded me of some TOS Battlestar Galactica ships, and the fact that it is the lifeblood of years of work and exploration, and that we saw every step of the way was incredible.

&amp;#x200B;

About halfway through to the 7th season, I don't remember where exactly, but I heard of a ship known as the BC-304, originally I thought it was a fan-made ship, and I was to scared about spoilers to look it up, so I just buried the thought in my near empty mind. But after I was done with season 7, and I saw the "" Lost City "", It made me think, "" Wait--- Where the hell are the rest of the ships? "", I was thinking this, because in season 6 ( It was fresh in my mind... I watched them both in  3 days... ) They mad mentioned that the US gave Russia the schematics for the F-302, and at the time, X-303. I had the thought that "" Ehh-- Maybe they had no time, or couldn't get the resources. "" but then I remembered--- That is also BS, they have off-world mines for Trinium, and Naquada, why the hell could they build only ONE ship, when they had dozens, maybe even a hundred or so fighters for the battle of Antarctica.

&amp;#x200B;

I was at a loss, I thought it was a simple plot gap, or I overlooked something. But than, in the season 8 finale, we saw schematics of a new Tau'ri ship, and Sam saying it was the "" Daedalus "". Call me dumb, but I forgot about the BC-304 at that point, and I wasn't really "" watching "" as I was listening, at the time, so I had assumed it was finally another BC-303, and it had upgrades the Prometheus had-- After watching Moebius, I went to the Atlantis season 1 finale and season 2 premier, I finally figured out that the Daedalus was not a Prometheus-Class.. But it was the most amazing Sci-Fi ship I had ever seen in my entire f\*cking life... I remember literally SCREAMING as I saw the Daedalus come in guns blazing, it was such an epic entrence.

&amp;#x200B;

As the series' went on, we saw more and more of these guys being built and sent to fight, the *Daedalus*, the *Odyssey*, *Korolev*, *Apollo*, *Sun Tzu*, and my personal favorite the USS *George Hammond,* I don't think I can describe in words how much I love this ship, it not only has a history of it's own, but we see how it is the perfect improvement of the Prometheus-Class, it's sleeker, more compact, more advanced technology, larger but with a smaller target profile, no bulky superstructure, the Tau'ri genuinely learned from their mistakes, and I may have cried when I heard Sam Carter saying the ship was called the George Hammond... Just such a good detail.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I have to say the BC-304 Daedalus-Class Battlecruiser is my favorite starship in all of science fiction... It's history, all the backstories of what it's made of ( literally and figuratively ), how and why it was constructed, to all of it's upgrades over the course of the series..

Aesthetics and Ships in the Culture Novels,"In short: Why are Culture Ships so ugly?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing some reading on aesthetics recently. There's a tension between sense and sensibility, reason and art, utility and virtue - and aesthetics lies between these. Aesthetic beauty can be seen as the condition when *something* transcends the simple function/form dichotomy: an object has a function outside of itself, and yet appears to have successfully subordinated function to form; it is a manifestation of freedom; a functionalisation of freedom, in a way.

In the Culture Novels by Iain M. Banks. In a post-scarcity society, there is little consideration for necessity. Beauty definitely exists as a valued concept - look at Tersono's body, Ziller's music, the Hydrogen Sonata, etc. Aesthetics continues to be valued, even when the domain of pure reason is dominated by non-organic Minds.

Enter the Ships. In all descriptions, they are noted to be horrifically practical. I've always imagined them as rectangular blocks of Swiss cheese, suspended in layers of red wax, gliding through space. Engine blocks here, accommodations sections there, actually-ver-big guns cleverly hidden over yonder. The only really spectacular descriptions appear when we get down to the nitty gritty of the GSVs. Yet, for all their intricacy, they are still rectangular blocks. For a post-scarcity society, why couldn't they craft themselves into physically beautiful forms? Surely Culture Minds must still care about the initial approach, a few kilometers out? If it costs them next to nothing to achieve greater aesthetic beauty, why wouldn't they? Maybe (let me imagine this, please) it is merely because Minds will never really *care* about aesthetics as we do. Because the just can't.

Is Neal Stephenson a Turing Machine?,"I thought I was a big fan. I read the Big U years ago, Snow Crash &amp; Cryptonomicon a few years later. His books are AOK!

Since I last picked up an NS novel, however, a close friend of mine made a passing comment on how there are so many Turing Machines in NS novels that it gets kind of old. Needless to say I called him a filthy liar and a jealous slanderer and ended the friendship immediately. Gotta cut out that bad energy.

Last month I plucked The Diamond Age off of the pile at my local used book shop, sensing an easy win. It’s Neal Stephenson! My ex-friend is a jerk! Let’s read the book. 

The book is ostensibly about nanobots, until about the halfway mark, after which every goddamned thing is a goddamned Turing Machine. The protagonist-princess has to navigate 11 castles to collect 11 keys, and each castle is a Turing Machine. Descriptions of the castles are limited almost entirely to how they are Turing Machines, and the interesting details are how each castle is a Turing Machine in a slightly different way. 

You wouldn’t guess how many different ways a castle could be a Turing Machine: by my count, it’s seven. When I realized what was going on I skipped the last four. 

A murder of crows engages is Turingmachinelike behavior. Interesting!

O fuck here comes a wizard! 

“But the wizard was undoubtedly a machine.” 

I’m 50 pages from the end and I can’t do this anymore. 

Someone tell me how it ends without saying “Turing Machine.” 

In conclusion, science fiction is a diverse and enlightening genre. ","Is Neal Stephenson a Turing Machine? I thought I was a big fan. I read the Big U years ago, Snow Crash &amp; Cryptonomicon a few years later. His books are AOK!

"[Self-Promo Saturday] New SciFi Book, Deep Hydra","&amp;#x200B;

[Art by Michael Lam](https://i.redd.it/mmbczdlld3l21.jpg)

Nero must destroy his creator to save the woman he loves and the Confederation he defends.

&amp;#x200B;

Deep Hydra is the last book in the Chronicles of the Orion Spur series, but it is also functional as a stand-alone work (though it helps to read the first 3 books). The series centers around a plot to overthrow a corporate democracy and the fight to defend it. I've got aliens, robots, AI, cyborgs, space battles, and personal struggles woven together into one cohesive story. Did my best to stick with real physics with a few exceptions, and if you decide to give it a shot I hope you enjoy it.

Oh, and expect the same level of detail/violence/etc as an R-Rated movie.

Deep Hydra, is out now for Kindle ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P1HTCZQ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P1HTCZQ)) and in Print ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/0997204419](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0997204419)).","[Self-Promo Saturday] New SciFi Book, Deep Hydra &amp;#x200B;

Untouched area of sci-fi that is the most futuristic,"In all the science fiction I have ever watched or read there has never been anything that covers the unification of planet earth.

And like it or not in 100 to 150 years are grand children and great grand children will unite countries in the name of humanity and equality. Probably western Christian countries joining together like the U.S and Canada then Australia creating a ultra super power. Then Latin America will join. The E. U. Will become a solid one country. Which will make Australia, north and South America and Europe just two countries. The Arab  world will be come one country. Central and South Africa will unite. India, China and south east Asia will be all that are left. Making 195 countries into 7-10’countries depending how you want to play it out. At which point all those countries will unite and become one world country. Then we will explore space as one  planet United. In all the shows they are talking to aliens and exploring space.

It’s not like In the Orville for instance there is like the North American country African country and China individually in the planetary union there all there as just earth. the humans represent all of earth that’s it period end of story. So they have to be united in one country. Also I for one do believe in aliens. Which I’m assuming everyone else does.

Year period of earth before the final 5 countries join as one. Then finally explore space under one united planet or am I just a idiot?

Then aliens come Down and are like “congrats we been watching for 3,000 years waiting for use guys to finally be united. Welcome to the trylon galaxy or What you guys call the milk way. The average planet takes 1300 years to unite in one country and explore space once the whole planets continental territories are connected you guys did it in only 700 years top 24%.” I just want to know how the world united before Star Trek.

Looking for a sci-fi graphic novel/comic recommendation that deals with cramped urban cities and alien societies,"I recently finished Kill Six Billion Demons and I was blown away by the art and scale of the urban landscapes as well as diversity of the background cast.

I'm looking for any sci-fi comic that is set in a similar sprawling urban city except sci-fi instead of fantasy and populated by aliens instead of demons.

My first thought was to look for star wars comics, however the locations featured in most comics I saw were set in space, desert or inside spaceships. 

Does anyone have recommendations or hints where to start looking?","Looking for a sci-fi graphic novel/comic recommendation that deals with cramped urban cities and alien societies I recently finished Kill Six Billion Demons and I was blown away by the art and scale of the urban landscapes as well as diversity of the background cast.

It almost seemed far fetched at that time, or at least way more than only a few decades before it actually happens. The idea also seemed as if intended for the wealthy, rather than all middle class working consumers.

Chaning the past by predicting the future,"If one could predict the future, then on some level that almost implies we are living in the past.

Without an accurate prediction of the future, the concept of ""changing the past"" gets devoured by logic and science.

But those who can predict the future, in some way do alter the past. You haved moved forward in time, determined what will happen as if it has already occurred, then you ""return here"" to the past and change it.

Example:
The guy who won the lottery 7 times. (Yes, he actually did that).
He predicted the future, seven times, ""returned to the present"" which effectively has become ""the past"" changed his life entirely.

This really happened.

"Sci-fi is my favourite genre, but I hate most of it.","I love some sci-fi so much

It gives me the \[makes explosion sound while expanding fingers out from head\] feeling of reading popular science, but the skilled sci-fi writer will present it in such a way as to heighten it even more.

A good sci-fi writer will introduce plausible and well thought out ideas that I've never even considered before.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, loving the good stuff so much, I am especially disdainful of the rest.

I have read a lot of sci-fi and the only stuff I remember being good so far is..

\* Most Arthur C Clarke novels and short stories

\* Most Kim Stanley Robinson novels

\* Accelerando by Charles Stross

\* The Martian

&amp;#x200B;

All the rest is either...

1. Really just a fantasy novel with superficial sci-fi genre trappings.
2. Really just a drama novel with superficial sci-fi genre trappings.
3. Has few or no interesting or novel ideas
4. Has Half baked ideas, research was not done, or the details were not worked out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd rate some stuff by Stephen Baxter as borderline. Generally, he presents some brilliant ideas, but with very little following through on the details and too many pages devoted to drama.

I've also really enjoyed pure fantasy stuff like Dune, Iain M Banks, and Larry Niven, but I wouldnt really count them as sci-fi and they certainly didnt give me that kick I mention at the top of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I love sci-fi so much but it has also made me a sci-fi snob.

Just wondering what others think of that.

Also please recommend something you'd think I'd like!

Question inspired by the Twilight Zone episode The Little People,"Let's say a mile high alien landed on Earth. It stomps around, say, destroys a city or something, and for whatever reason we can't retaliate. Then it declares itself God. Do you believe the majority of people would think of it as a God?

[Question] What are Time Travel's effect on the host?,"So, I dabble in writing, and I can't get this idea for a short story out of my head, inspired a lot by ""The Umbrella Academy"". I don't have the kinks worked out, but in this world I'd essentially create, the protagonist is a time traveller, doing time travelling things, as their superpower.

I already worked out that time travelling would not only be a difficult to use as a super power (calculating for exact times, making sure not to appear inside things, etc) but also be really taxing on a person biologically. Like, you're decompressing yourself in a vortex of time and then popping up someplace else; it's gonna hurt and it's gonna do some temporary, if not permanent, damage.

So, I was wondering, what kind of effects would it have on a person? I'd say they'd get dizzy, probably get a blood nose, faint or pass out most like, even get a severe shortness of breath. I also thought they'd lack in some nutrition, maybe they need to chug down a gallon of water or something just to ease the effects.

Thoughts? It'd really help. Thanks!

I really liked The Expanse and would love to hear suggestions for other great scifi series.,"Seeing expanse really made me crave more. I watched altered carbon and dark matter and liked both, albeit not as much as expanse. Dark matter was pretty cheesy which was quite off-putting at first but i ended up getting invested anyway.

I saw battlestar galactica(2004) and firefly years ago and liked both a lot. I have read a lot of science fiction and generally prefer space operas over more contemporary settings, but its not a must and i really enjoyed black mirror.

There is a galaxy called Sky River Galaxy in the awful vast universe. And there is a planet called Alpha in this galaxy. On the planet Alpha, there lives a human species named Alphian. Since the birth of the Alphian, they have been developing in the form of Communism all the way since their primitive society. It is a planetary civilization with extremely fast development of science and technology. It took less than 500 years to develop from the low-level cosmic civilization to the high-level cosmic civilization.

With the help of the advanced universal science and technology, the Alphian finally discovered that the universe is infinite. There is no such thing as a cosmic boundary. There is never an end in exploring the truth of the universe, so they come to a conclusion: If the purpose of surviving in the universe is just for exploring the truth of the universe, it will inevitably lead to self-destruction.

&amp;#x200B;

So they unanimously decided to do something more meaningful. They decided to leave the Sky River galaxy to search for other civilizations in the universe, and grant and teach these civilizations with their advanced cosmic science and technology, expecting to unite all the civilizations in the universe to build a Cosmic Family and let the universe be as full of life as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

After setting this goal, the Alphian began to send space exploration teams to all directions of the universe with the Sky River Galaxy as the center.

&amp;#x200B;

.

**2**

Soon, the Alphian arrives a galaxy called the Golden Way Galaxy.

&amp;#x200B;

The Alphian found that there are five low-level civilizations in the Golden Way Galaxy, they are also human beings, and because of the backwardness of their science and technology, these five civilizations do not know each other’s existence.

&amp;#x200B;

Among these five low-level civilizations, one planet called Omega is the most technologically advanced civilization. After studying this Omega planet, the Alphian found that the development process of the Omegian civilization is completely different to theirs. The Omegian civilization’s development is based on private ownership all the way. In the course of the Omegian civilization development, it was full of various wars and massacres. And finally, the entire Omega planet was divided into hundreds of countries.

&amp;#x200B;

After careful consideration, the Alphian found that they can not directly grant and teach the Omegian civilizations with their advanced universal science and technology, otherwise the Omegian would quickly go to self-destruction due to a small number of Omegian holding the highest power and most resources, which the Omegian call them “leaders” and “governments”.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, the Alphian decided to help the Omegian to build a powerful artificial intelligence system called ""Superbrain"" to manage and distribute the entire Omegian society, deprive and decentralize power from the small number of Omegian and disband all the governments on the Omegian planet, which means, the Superbrain is the whole Omegian planet’s “government”. 

Through the management of Superbrain, all the Omegian people are equal, no body has special rights or supreme power, and people don’t need currencies to live and trade any more.

&amp;#x200B;

After years, under the help of Superbrain, the Omegian civilization developed into communist society successfully, there no longer has classes, countries and wars on the Omega planet, all the Omegian people unite together to live and help each other.

&amp;#x200B;

After the rapid realization of the communist society on the Omega planet, the Alphian tells the Omegian that there are four other low-level civilizations in the Golden Way Galaxy. They are Beta Planet, Gamma Planet, Froxima Planet and Kappa Planet. They give the Omegian an very important mission: To help the other four civilizations in the Golden Way Galaxy to develop into a communist society by granting and teaching them with advanced science and technology without reservation, and then unite them together to develop other inanimate planets in the entire Golden Way Galaxy, carry out interstellar colonization, and fill the Golden Way Galaxy with life. 

The Alphian also says that they will return to the Golden Way Galaxy after a thousand years to help the entire Golden Way Civilization to join into the Cosmic Family.

&amp;#x200B;

The Omegian promised to the Alphian that they will shoulder these heavy responsibilities and complete the great mission.

After getting the promise of Omegian, the Alphian left the Golden Way Galaxy and keep going to the next galaxy to spread advanced civilization science and technology.

&amp;#x200B;

After sending away the Alphian with tears, the Omegian began to send spaceships to the other four low-level civilizations in the Golden Way Galaxy.

&amp;#x200B;

When the Omegian came to the first low-level civilization, they saw that the science and technology on this Beta planet is very low-level. And just like the Omega planet used to be, this Beta planet is also full of wars and massacres.

The Omegian saw the scenes of the Betian killing each other, the flesh and blood, and the materialistic desires, which just exactly what they used to be and enjoy with. While seeing the wars and massacres on the Beta planet, the Omegian felt a very familiar pleasure deeply in the their hearts, a pleasure that had never been seen for a long time, and a strong desire of controlling arises spontaneously in their hearts.

As a result, the Omegian decided to grant their advanced science and technology with reservation to the Betian. 

The Omegian also help the development of the other three civilizations in the Golden Way Galaxy by this way of granting and teaching with reservation.

The Omegian breached their oath.

&amp;#x200B;

.

**3**

After 900 years, the Alphian come to the Golden Way Galaxy early with full expectation.

&amp;#x200B;

When the Alphian passing through some of the planets which never have life before in the Golden Way, it was strange for the Alphian to find that these planets had signs of life being destroyed, it seemed to be created and then destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, the Alphian came to the Beta planet of the four low-level civilizations which they did not personally grant and teach with their advanced science and technology.

&amp;#x200B;

The Alphian frighteningly and desperately discover that what lives on the Beta planet are all kinds of grotesque monsters that partially look like humans but not humans: Some of these monsters’ hips are extremely large and warped, because of their buttocks are too large and too warped, this creature can only crawl on the ground with their four limbs to move forward; Some of these monsters’ boobs are extremely big, because of their boobs are too big and too heavy, this creature can only place their boobs on a small cart and push the cart to move; Some of these monsters’ mouth is very tight and tender, and there is no tooth inside their mouth, there are only soft gums; Some of these monsters’ whole body is fully covered with something shaped like lips, some are full of cylindrical meat sticks with different sizes, and some are full of tits...

And the people who manage the survival of all these monsters are a group of very normal Betian human beings.

&amp;#x200B;

The Alphian controlled one of the Betian managers. Under the interrogation of the Alphian, this manager revealed the truth: ""The Omegian divides all the human beings in the Golden Way into first-class citizens, second-class citizens, third-class citizens. All the Omegian are first-class citizens, and all four other civilizations’ people are third-class citizens, and second-class citizens are promoted from these third-class citizens as managers of these four civilizations, and they manage the four planets on behalf of the Omegian. Under the impetus of this class system and the infinite desire of the Omegian, in addition to the Omegian civilization, the other four civilizations gradually evolved into four Desire planets only for the enjoyment of the Omegian with the help of genetic editing technology and various kinds of other developed science and technology in less than five hundred years: the Appetite planet, the Libido planet, the Violent planet, the Clown planet. ”

&amp;#x200B;

After the Alphian learned the truth, they carried out a humane elimination of this Betian manager. And after careful deliberation, the Alphian decided to destroy the entire Beta planet and relieve all the pain of all these monsters.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Without stopping and rest, the Alphian quickly came to the Gamma planet. 

What the Alphian saw on the Gamma planet is just exactly the same with what the Betian manager has told them. The Gamma planet is a violent planet: In the air, there are all kinds of speeding flying cars are chasing and killing each other; On the ground, there are various houses and factories, and inside these buildings, there are all kinds of ever-changing traps, and prisoners needs to kill each other to survive and avoid being killed by these traps.

In the space orbit of this Gamma planet, there are various satellite cameras. On the planet, there are also filled with all kinds of constantly swaying ground and aerial cameras. It seems that all the bloody and violent images/scenes on this violent planet are being recorded all the time. Everything that happens on the Gamma planet is broadcast live at a 7-24-hour, and all these bloody images are being sent to the Omega planet.

&amp;#x200B;

After seeing everything on the Gamma planet, the Alphian destroy the entire Gamma planet without hesitation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately after destroying Gamma, the Alphian came to the Froxima planet. 

This is a planet with colorful lights everywhere, and playing various types of music, such as dynamic, thrilling, clownish, funny, cute and etc. And the Froximian people perform a variety of clownish, funny and thrilling performances under these various kinds of background music.

&amp;#x200B;

The Alphian once again fell into meditation. Eventually, they carried out a humane elimination of all the Froximian managers and then left the Froxima Planet. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the Alphian came to the last of the four enslaved civilizations, the Kappa planet. On the Kappa planet, in addition to the Kappian managers and robots, no other Kappian people can be seen on the planet. Instead, various utensils filled with nutrient solution are placed everywhere on the Kappa planet. Inside these utensils are all growing embryos. All of these babies are made using genetic editing technology, and the birth efficiency is surprisingly high. Under the transformation of gene editing technology, the flesh and skins of these babies are extremely tender.

&amp;#x200B;

After carrying out a humane elimination of all the Kappian managers and re-engineering and re-programming the robots, the Alphian left the Kappa planet.

&amp;#x200B;

.

**4**

At last, the Alphian came to the Omega planet, but found that the Omegian have long been waiting and ready to war.

&amp;#x200B;

The Omegian used the advanced science and technology developed by the Alphian to create a variety of extremely advanced weapons, but the Alphian never did too much research on weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

The Alphian realized that they are unable to destroy the Omegian by conventional means, but if they don't destroy the Omegian, with the development and expansion of the Omegian, it will be a disaster for other galaxies, civilizations and lifes in the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

After sending messages of everything they saw in the Golden Way back to the Alpha planet, the Alphian took a suicide attack on the Omega planet and eventually died with the Omegian.

&amp;#x200B;

The Alpha planet civilization received all the information from the Golden Way, and broadcast all the information on the Alpha planet with awful grief.

&amp;#x200B;

Afterwards, the Alphian civilization conducted in-depth research and reflection on this entire event of Golden Way, and finally came to the conclusion: Any low-level civilization developed on the basis of private ownership, under the influence of private ownership for thousands of years and tens of thousands of years, there will generate a very special and evil gene in this kind of human species’ genes. In order to eliminate this kind of evil gene, it is a must to rely on this kind of low-level civilization’s own efforts to eliminate it. Through their own efforts, persevering ideological struggles, and uniting their own people together to promote the development of the entire society towards communist society, during the struggling process this evil gene will naturally be eliminated.

&amp;#x200B;

After reaching such a conclusion, the Alphian adopted a cutting-edge cosmic science and technology that can only be mastered by advanced high-level cosmic civilizations to continuously send cosmic broadcasts to all directions of the universe with the Sky River Galaxy as the center, informing all other high-level cosmic civilizations in the universe that they must not grant and teach low-level civilizations which developed on the basis of private ownership with advanced cosmic science and technology. Otherwise, it will cause other cosmic civilizations and life to be ruined, and it is a must to let these low-level civilizations develop naturally through their own efforts. Let them evolve into the communist society through their own efforts and eventually integrate into the entire universe family. All the high-level cosmic civilizations must hide themselves and keep away from this kind of low-level civilizations.

&amp;#x200B;

This broadcast is constantly and uninterruptedly spreading in the universe...

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, the scope of this constantly spreading broadcast becomes larger and larger in the infinite universe, its spreading distance becomes farther and farther, and eventually spread to a galaxy called the Milky Way.

&amp;#x200B;

In this so-called the Milky Way galaxy, there are also five human civilizations. Among them, the Earth civilization in the solar system is the most developed civilization, and just as the same as the Omega civilization, it is also a human society developed on the basis of private ownership.

&amp;#x200B;

Driven by the private ownership, the Earth civilization is also gradually developed from the primitive society to the slave society, and from the slave society to the feudal society, and then from the feudal society to the capitalist society.

The science and technology of the earth civilization have also been gradually developed, and finally achieved the Moon landing and the Mars landing.

&amp;#x200B;

With the development of science and technology of earth civilization and the earthmen's deeper exploration of the solar system, aliens and extraterrestrial civilizations have gradually become a very hot topic on this planet. People are always arguing over whether there are aliens in the universe. It is very ridiculous that they do not know that a broadcast from a high-level cosmic civilization has been continuously transmitted to and even spread throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Due to the backwardness of science and technology, the earthmen cannot know the existence of this broadcast.

In order to find out whether there are aliens in the universe or not, the people on Earth host a grand global debate. At this globally high-profile debate conference, all the elites in all fields of the Earth world were brought together to fiercely debate whether there are aliens in the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

Just when everyone is red-faced and published their opinions, a scientist named Fermi raised a question that caused all the noisy debates to come to an abrupt end: ""Where is everybody?""

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then, a great paradox was born on Earth, and the Earthmen proudly name this paradox as the Fermi Paradox.

&amp;#x200B;

End.

"Broader, more fancy than Leviathan Wakes/The Expanse","Hi all,

I’m fairly new to sci-fi. I began reading Leviathan Wakes (have avoided the TV show) after seeing it recommended a lot here. It’s written fantastically. Really good characters, modern tone of voice in the narration and dialogue, and a lot of action and pace. 

Trouble is, although I’m enjoying it and will finish it, and will read further in the series at some point, I wanted something a bit more fantastical/futuristic. I’ve seen Star Trek, and Doctor Who, and all your standard sci-fi films etc (although never seen Star Wars cos I can’t face those old films now and I realise I’m missing out but plz don’t shoot me lol). And I LOVED Children of Time, and plodded through Consider Phlebas.

I fancy reading a currently active author who’s still putting out stuff (so will tend towards modern plotting, language and pace) that I can look forward to new releases etc, who writes the same kind of action- and character-packed books that Leviathan Wakes represents. I have Revelation Space and Pandora’s Star, but they seem potentially quite dense...? 

I guess I’m looking for the sword and sorcery version of sci-fi, an easy fun read but set in the fantastical future, not just our solar system. Any ideas welcome! Thanks. 

Edit: I must sound like a complete heathen here. Apologies. I’ve gotten into fantasy recently and just read Stormlight Archive pretty quickly and am now doing Wheel of Time then Malazan. It took me reading shorter/less dense/action packed/more instantly rewarding stuff (with all the stuff I like, like magic battles and cool characters) to get into the genre to the point where I can now read epic series and ‘harder’ stuff because I’m socialised to the conventions of the genre. I guess with sci-fi i like scary aliens and cool ships versus complex astrophysics...? Or whatever the genre’s things are. ","Broader, more fancy than Leviathan Wakes/The Expanse Hi all,

I’ve seen Star Trek, and Doctor Who, and all your standard sci-fi films etc (although never seen Star Wars cos I can’t face those old films now and I realise I’m missing out but plz don’t shoot me lol). And I LOVED Children of Time, and plodded through Consider Phlebas.

I fancy reading a currently active author who’s still putting out stuff (so will tend towards modern plotting, language and pace) that I can look forward to new releases etc, who writes the same kind of action- and character-packed books that Leviathan Wakes represents. I have Revelation Space and Pandora’s Star, but they seem potentially quite dense...? 

I guess I’m looking for the sword and sorcery version of sci-fi, an easy fun read but set in the fantastical future, not just our solar system. Any ideas welcome! Thanks. 

Edit: I must sound like a complete heathen here. Apologies. I’ve gotten into fantasy recently and just read Stormlight Archive pretty quickly and am now doing Wheel of Time then Malazan. It took me reading shorter/less dense/action packed/more instantly rewarding stuff (with all the stuff I like, like magic battles and cool characters) to get into the genre to the point where I can now read epic series and ‘harder’ stuff because I’m socialised to the conventions of the genre. I guess with sci-fi i like scary aliens and cool ships versus complex astrophysics...? Or whatever the genre’s things are. "

Is legal science fiction even a thing?,"I'm a Dutch privacy lawyer and I wrote a short science fiction story on how the EU's GDPR and its mechanism for private enforcement could derail innovation and AI in Europe in 2038. It won first prize at the Dutch Institute for Information Law's Science Fiction competition. One jury member remarked it's novel to see the law used as a plot device to derail innovation. Usually (especially in dystopia settings) you see the law as weakless against the Big Bad, or technology being too powerful and fast. 

I must admit most SF I know has the law only as a sideshow, but aren't there any real legal science fiction stories/novels out there? Where the law and its enforcement is the plot, rather than just a device to derail the protagonist?

If you don't want a man unhappy  politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give  him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing  as war. If the government is inefficient, top-heavy, and tax-mad,  better it be all those than that people worry over it. Peace, Montag.  Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more  popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew  last year.

Question about Star Trek Careers,"So today I was thinking, what is a career path/posting cycle for a Starfleet soldier?

Is there a defined posting cycle for them? Serve here for [x] years, put up a preference for posting to [y] ship or [z] starbase?

As an example, in the Australian Military, for the most part, as an enlisted person, it's 3 year cycles.

Take a logistics soldier for example:

&gt;Finish Basic
&gt;First 3 years will be at a ""First Line"" logistics support unit, might pick up a promotion course
&gt;Second 3 years, generally pick up first promotion, get a ""Second line"" or ""Third line"" unit, pick up your second promotion in your last year there
&gt;At this point you've been promoted twice, instructor positions in your trade or as a recruit instructor are open to you.
&gt;Generally 3-6 years at your second rank level then you get promoted again
&gt;From here it's still 3 year postings, smattering of 2 year posts thrown in, ~6 years between promotion.

Keeping in mind Australia goes PTE-LCPL-CPL-SGT-WO2-WO1 that's it. I know other military have grades of ranks so there is ""more"" promotions to go around.

For the officers it's generally:

&gt;Basic
&gt;3 Years at a First Line, complete your Logistics Officer Course here
&gt;Another 3 years, complete your captains course
&gt;At 6 years, promote to Captain
&gt;9-12 Years do your Majors courses, some get as early as 7-8
&gt;~15 Years you're a Major
&gt;Now you've generally got 2 year postings from here on in

Now, normally from my experience, they don't like, for example, an Infantry Officer to just Infanfeer all the way to LTCOL level, in that time he'll leave his trade, go do Instructional Time, Staff time, maybe be an ADC as a LT or CAPT, spend time in a policy development role, maybe an overseas posting with another military to enhance skills.

Stargate SG-1,"I just finished watching season one of this show. The Kurt Russell movie was a lot of fun to watch, so I figured I might enjoy these many seasons of television series which spawned from it.

My God. This show is complete shit. 

* Let's go to an alien world and have no decontamination before we expose ourselves to other people back on Earth

* Aliens all over the galaxy speak English for no reason

* 1960's style sexist woman in bikini dancing or daughter offered as thanks

* Often a character will state that something could not be done, then 5 minutes later someone will do it because the writers forgot about the plot.

* Racist/Ethnocentric and inaccurate portrayals of other cultures from Earth (Mongols early in Season One are nothing like Mongols and are played by Japanese and Mexicans).

* Sometimes there are plot devices that don't even make sense. The star gate cannot be seen, but you can see the spot where it was? Just walk over and feel for it, but no, let's start a grid search and walk away from that spot.

How the hell does something like Firefly or The Expanse have trouble staying on TV, but this shit festival of cringe managed to stay on for almost 20 years?

Terminator and Vulcan's Hammer?,So I just read PKD's book Vulcan's Hammer for the first time. It was pretty good 50s sci-fi. A good warning about AI. My question is do you think James Cameron got the idea for Skynet from the book? By his own admission he read ACE paperbacks when he was young. This was an ace paperback that came out when he was a kid. I see so many similarities between Vulcan 3 and Skynet. The super computer that eventually turns on its creators.,Terminator and Vulcan's Hammer? So I just read PKD's book Vulcan's Hammer for the first time. It was pretty good 50s sci-fi.

Outbreak/pandemic/viral/biological type thing recommendations,"Hi all. 

I love outbreak films (Contagion, Outbreak, 28 Days, even Rec). I loved Girl With All The Gifts and its companion book (and the film). I am new to sci-fi as a genre. I’ve read Children Of Time, Consider Phlebas and the MaddAdam Margaret Atwood stuff, and that’s about it. I am a huge reader more generally. 

Do you have any recommendations for good books along the ideas above please? Doesn’t need to be set in the future, although I’d also like current books rather than set in the past or written too long ago (I’m a scientist and old science bugs me haha). Zombies are okay per se, but I like the biological peril (argh! The hazmat suit has ripped open or argh you’re stuck in the airlock!) rather than running away from hordes of zombies/gun and survival stuff peril. Although I did love 28 Days etc., but have got bored of S6 of Walking Dead. Also, just to add to the specificity of my request (really sorry!), I’m not mega into environmental/Gaia themes (although tbh I’ve not really read much along those lines except Atwood, which I did love...). 

Any remotely suitable suggestions would be welcome. Thank you! ","Outbreak/pandemic/viral/biological type thing recommendations Hi all.

Could Robocop Be Tied Or Connected To Starship Troopers,"The following of course is a fan theory.  One that when I started to look into it, at first might seem coincidence, looking at it much closer?  It seems after all might just in fact could be tied together.  

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the theory...

&amp;#x200B;

When we look at the Federation in the 23rd century of Starship Troopers we see a strong fascist type militant government/organization that dominates Earth.  They are unified, and of course put into a war with bugs, aka Arachnids.  Militant, armed to the teeth, and gungho ready to go into battle the Federation in some ways parallel the Colonial Marines from the Alien franchise.  But the interesting thing about Starship Troopers is when we look at Robocop this has to be asked...

&amp;#x200B;

Could Starship Troopers be tied to Robocop at all?  

&amp;#x200B;

Well the possibility might be a yes.  And it all comes down to one company...OCP or Omni Consumer Products.  As we know first off BOTH films were directed by Paul Verhoeven so that is a plus.  But if we look at the Federation and also OCP?  That's where the similarities parallel each other.  

&amp;#x200B;

1:  OCP A Defense Contractor

&amp;#x200B;

It's no secret that Omni Consumer Products had their hands in defense contracting and of course in Robocop this plays out as a major plot too when it comes their ambition to turn Old Detroit into Delta City.  We see this in the beginning of the movie with the conference on the introduction of the ED-209 which stands for Enforcement Droid series 209.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://robocop.fandom.com/wiki/ED-209](https://robocop.fandom.com/wiki/ED-209)

&amp;#x200B;

As it turns out of course while the ED-209 was designed for military applications it was also being marketed as for uses in urban pacification.  So the evidence of OCP having roots as a private military contractor is there.  

&amp;#x200B;

2:  The United Citizen Federation And Duty For Citizenship

&amp;#x200B;

In Starship Troopers the movie we find that citizenship in the Federation means doing your part or duty for your right to be a citizen.  Even the movie itself plays it out as one big giant propaganda film.  Now this could be stroked up as an artist interpretation by Paul Verhoeven himself.  Kind of like Ridley Scott and James Cameron interpreted the Alien franchise as well.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a little information on the Federation in Starship Troopers:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://starshiptroopers.fandom.com/wiki/United\_Citizen\_Federation](https://starshiptroopers.fandom.com/wiki/United_Citizen_Federation)

&amp;#x200B;

As it turns out again the United Citizen Federation or Terran Federation...(so many Star Trek jokes could be made about this right now...LOLZ) carries a very rigid, tough, stern, dedicated mentality that every person in the Federation has a duty and obligation.  Both divisions the Federation have ranging from Psi Intelligence, to Mobile Infantry, and even UCF Fleets or navy.  Carry a very well organized and structured support that seems to be well described as, ""incorporated"".  ANOTHER feature often found in something like OCP when it comes to their organization as well.  

&amp;#x200B;

So when factoring these two what is the theory?  It could be plausible in the setting of Robocop that OCP ended up being the foundation in military research and development that existed in the movie.  It is also known that OCP by Robocop III did contract out mercenaries to deal with some task.  This example in this rigid military/corporate structuring could be found also in the Urban Rehabilitators program.  Or Rehabs for short were the basis of which was used to force residents out of Old Detroit to where they were claimed to be relocated but in fact processed to implement ""imminent domain"" by OCP since Detroit went bankrupt by Robocop II thus allowing OCP to step in after it was acquired by a foreign company.  

&amp;#x200B;

In turn OCP becomes the foundation for the beginnings in policy of the United Citizen Federation as a whole back then, but would take time to develop and evolve into the 23rd century Roughnecks government we know in Starship Troopers.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know bold theory, but GOD does it make Starship Troopers SO awesome.  Thank you Paul Verhoeven, THANK YOU!  XD

""Tree House Time Machine"" by Alan Ritchson

&amp;#x200B;

An eager 12-year-old boy and his friends secretly travel back in time in the hopes of unraveling the mystery surrounding his mother's untimely death before the rightful owner of the machine realizes it's gone missing.

&amp;#x200B;

If a time machine powered by lightning isn't dangerous enough, Charlie and his friends are playing a game of Russian Roulette whenever they decide to travel through time and space. With no way to control when or where they end up, it's anyone's guess as to whether they'll be dancing to the real Elvis or running from a T-rex.  

For one brave and earnest 12-year-old boy, Charlie, the risk is worth the reward. He wants nothing more than to go back to a time when his mother is alive again. His ﬁercely loyal best friends, Puck and Vincent, are always up for the adventure. But after what happened the last time they traveled, they swore a sacred oath to end time travel for good. When a particularly haunting storm rolls through town, Charlie's desire tp travel gets the best of him. But his friends know him all too well. They bust him at Charlie's tree house, their preferred place to travel from, before he can take off.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, for the ""Three Musketeers,' Pucks blabbermouth has brought some uninvited guests along for the ride. With the secret ﬁnally out, the group is forced to travel with the impulsive and audacious 13-year-old Maggie and her 18 year old meathead brother Bruiser. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Charlie's father, Jason is awoken by their dog Sunny, he realizes Charlie's gone missing. As he and Sunny race to trace Charlie's steps through the rain, he notices the tree house as it explodes with the mysterious electromagnetic energy of the activated time machine. But before he can reach the kids, he notices an ominous hooded ﬁgure watching the tree house from the dark forest nearby.  

&amp;#x200B;

Tree House Time Machine is a proof of concept short intended for an episodic television format. Set in the 90's, it captures the in-demand nostalgia of that era and is akin to Goonies meets Back to the Future. A dramedy with as much heart as laughs, Tree House Time Machine is sure to entertain kids of all ages.","Alan Ritchson's (Hawk in Titans) Sci-Fi Short Film ""Tree House Time Machine"" Playing on DUST: [https://youtu.be/yu9t8QBpCg4](https://youtu.be/yu9t8QBpCg4)

Sci-fi novels about resisting an alien occupation?,"After seeing the trailer for [Captive State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i68xCzI406A), I'm looking for sci-fi novels set against the backdrop of an alien occupation.

Creepiest quote from a show or movie?,"I freaked out when Dr. Crusher was talking to the computer in Star Trek when people were all disappearing but she was the only one who could remember they ever existed. And everyone around her said she was going mad, even though there were like hundreds of empty rooms. Everything from the writing, acting, lighting, sound, and delivery made it absolutely terrifying the moment she’s the last person and the computer says: 

“The universe is a spherical region 705 meters in diameter.”

Holy hell it was like twilight zone. I wish we could have more of that kind of horror instead of the pop-up gore kind. Not that I’m against gore, just that it’s much more impressive when I can be freaked out through a single subtle line.","Creepiest quote from a show or movie?

Enjoying The Exapanse on Amazon Prime,"I have had a roku tv with Amazon prime for a while but I've only ever watched movies. Thanks to this sub i decided to give The Expanse a try and I'm very glad i did. I'm halfway through season two and really enjoying it. 

I still find it all slightly confusing and i think that's due to a bit subpar writing and directing, where important plot points or relationships are not clear, but that's my only complaint. 

Overall it scratches that hard core sci fi itch that is usually very hard to find on tv. 

Highly recommended. ","Enjoying The Exapanse on Amazon Prime I have had a roku tv with Amazon prime for a while but I've only ever watched movies. Thanks to this sub i decided to give The Expanse a try and I'm very glad i did. I'm halfway through season two and really enjoying it.

'Helicopter taxi' Discussion,"In this context, a 'helicopter taxi' is a type of hybrid helicoptor that can switch its blade to fixed wing and then proceed to be propelled by maybe jet turbines.

&amp;#x200B;

AFAIK, two versions have been shown, in the movie 'The 6th Day' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and [Neill Blomkamp's version in Popular Science magazine (Nov 2003)](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-06/directing-district-9-neill-blomkamp-illustrated-popular-science#page-3). The former version can even change the blade into swept wing mode during high-speed flight.

&amp;#x200B;

So who exactly came out with this flying concept back in 2000 in Arnold's film? Is there any backstory about the design?","'Helicopter taxi' Discussion In this context, a 'helicopter taxi' is a type of hybrid helicoptor that can switch its blade to fixed wing and then proceed to be propelled by maybe jet turbines.

Alita impression from a fan of the manga (tldr: it's very good),"I'm a big fan of Battle Angel Alita - the manga. In fact it's one of my all time favourites. That made me a bit nervous on the way to the cinema. Especially after what I'd consider a total waste of potential and missing the point of the Ghost in the Shell adaptation (again, the anime is one of my favourite SciFi movies ever). 

When I first saw the Alita trailer I was a bit freaked out. Yes, those eyes. I then didn't read or watch a single review before seeing it myself.

I was pleasantly surprised! They got it right. Alita has the right mix of cute and creepy for me. There's always more to her. And she develops from a child to a strong, female character; someone who stands up for her believes and isn't there to do what some guy tells her to do (like in so many other movies). And really, the movie only covers the first few volumes of the manga. She just started to get into her own. Those eyes? It's great! It works. They're a constant reminder that she's not human.

A bit of critique: I found the soundtrack underwhelming (but not annoying) and the world is a bit too clean for my liking. There was a lot of focus on her love story with Hugo but that's OK in the grander scheme of things. I just hope there will be a grander scheme. 

One last note: as a fan of the manga I found myself often hoping for a slow frame, almost a freeze of action when cyborgs get torn apart. I think that comes from reading the manga though where the eye can often lingers on a single picture, the action visible in its full glory. If anything I'd hope Robert Rodriguez will get bolder with the next part.

Thank you Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron for staying true to your source material!","Alita impression from a fan of the manga (tldr: it's very good) I'm a big fan of Battle Angel Alita - the manga.

Andre Norton - best book to try for the first time?,"Hi,

Any big fans of Andre Norton out there? 

The Portalist sent a magazine link to her work and I liked the sound of them (the zero zone, sargasso of space etc). 

I know the name but have never read her.

But I hear she's considered a YA author which puts me off a bit. Should I give her a read or will I find it aimed at teenagers?

If I go for it, what's the best series or stand alone to kick off with?

Thanks!","Andre Norton - best book to try for the first time? Hi,

Alita was a fun surprise!,"So I haven't had much hope for good sci-fi movies lately, and especially for any movies based on manga/anime.


Went to see Alita never having read the books or watched the anime, and I was really floored by it.  No, it wasn't perfect,  the biggest flaw was overuse of CG (I can't blame them too much for this given the cost of practical effects) and some poor casting for secondary character(s), but I think it is the best SF movie I've seen in a long time.  For some reason, despite the slick special effects tech, it felt to me like a bit of a throwback to 80s action movie sensibilities.  Maybe it was the dialogue from the bad guys... not sure.  But I liked it.  


I think what really put it over the top was that had a very *different feeling* to the typical, redundant SF/action movies that have come out lately (Marvel etc.)  It focuses on characters, is a FUN journey to follow, not dark and depressing.


If you like action based SF and don't mind some quirky humor and dialogue, I highly recommend seeing this in the theater.  I don't think it would have the same impact on a TV screen.","Alita was a fun surprise! So I haven't had much hope for good sci-fi movies lately, and especially for any movies based on manga/anime.

After it replicates for a while one of the machines is damaged and only retains part of the code for replicating. I needs to find and interface with another machine to compare codes. During this process minor differences in code are introduced. This leads to more of the machines pairing off to combine their respective cores into new versions. This introduces a form of reproductive mating to the machines and each generations code becomes different. 

But that setup is all I can remember. Would love to revisit if anyone can remember the title.","Looking for a particular story I'm looking for a particular short story or novel. I can't remember the title and don't remember enough details for a Google search to get me all the way there.

Great Prophecies of Nostradamus (1974) is a Japanese disaster film directed by Toshio Masuda, co-written by Yoshimitsu Banno, and scored by Isao Tomita.

Professor Nishiyama, after studying and interpreting the prophecies of Nostradamus, realizes that the end of the world is at hand. Unfortunately, nobody listens to him until it is too late. As the effects of mankind's tampering of the earth - radioactive smog clouds, hideously mutated animals, destruction of the ozone layer - rage out of control, the world leaders hurtle blindly toward the final confrontation.

This film is narrowly considered to be the ultimate disaster film. Included, but not limited to, are zombies, pollution, riots, natural disasters, cannibalism, and nuclear war.

Sadly, the film was banned many years ago, and remains unavailable to the public today.

&gt;This film looks like someone's nightmare placed on film. It skillfully weaves weird disastrous futuristic events into the lives of a family of protagonists while at other times reducing them to absent observers of a world gone wild.

I haven't seen the movie, FYI. It's currently inaccessible everywhere.

What motivates an AI?,"I'll put the TL;DR at the top: would general purpose, human-exceeding AI's require some sort of emotional subroutines for motivation? The basis for the question is below. 

From what I understand about biological evolution, we can look at our own minds as the logical result of optimization for our environment. We have examples of sessile animals like sponges and mobile yet brainless animals like jellyfish. They are less fit than animals that can sense food and move to it, sense predators and avoid them. We can say that it is a simple, programmatic response for a roach. We can say a roach isn't capable of knowing fear, it's just an evolutionary fact that movement away from certain kinds of stimulus means you live to reproduce and ones that did not flee do not reproduce. We can replicate this same behavior with simple robots. 

But when you get to more complex organism, there's clearly more at work. You look at a dog and you can see emotions at work. He'll shy away from scary stimulus, will show elation in your presence. It seems like the whole point of emotions in the higher animals is to provide better motivations for survival. Hunger to stimulate eating, avoidance of pain, the desire to mate. And the greatest emotional development seems to be among social animals. The ability to mentally model prey behavior to better catch them, model predator behavior to better avoid them, and to model the minds of your fellow critters to be better able to cooperate with them. 

What makes us human, what separates us from the other animals, is the degree of intense cooperation we are able to engage in, with language and learning ability we can pool our knowledge and scale it to the tribe, to the civilization. The archaeological record shows how our near ancestors could figure out how to make a tool and could show their fellows but there wasn't much innovation or broader communication at work. A tool from one point looks much the same as one made a hundred thousand years later. But eventually the modern human brain developed and the successful feedback loop went nuts. Better optimization begets more food which begets more babies which reinforces bigger brains which begets more food and bam, hairless apes overrun the planet. 

The thing that I think really drives this home is when people have a psychological disorder like ahedonism where they can feel no pleasure. Alexithymia, not being able to feel and describe emotions, people in these states can find little cause for doing anything and just sit there in a fugue. Even with sociopaths there's a lack of positive emotions and empathy but there's certainly other emotions at work, the darker ones. 

So this question turns to AI. Right now based on my understanding our AI's are still more like what the boffins call expert systems. They do what they do because of programming. They do not exceed their programming. Do we imagine they remain forever like genies in the lamp, capable of doing anything requested of them but having no desires or goals of their own? If we wanted to have a self-goal-setting AI, would it require emotions to make decisions? ","What motivates an AI?

Is the idea of conscious machines just science fiction?,"Isn't it better to ask open questions than to make statements disguised as questions?

Isn't the idea of conscious machines just science fiction?

No. I am not sure why you think human beings or other conscious entities are anything other than ""machines"".

Aren't our minds self referential problem solvers?

Yes, our brains are self-referential and they solve problems. ""Minds"" is a loose description of a higher-level abstraction which just confuses issues. It is like the emergent phenomenon of a ""picture"" arising from a bunch of bits representing pixels.

Why do we still entertain such ideas in a post Godelian world?

Gödel's theorems about formal systems have little if anything to say about intelligence, consciousness, or the ability of machines. It is similar ""mystical"" thinking to the suggestion that ""minds"" are not ""machines"".

Or is the debate still well and alive?

I dare say the debate is alive and well. Historically anything that suggests there is something special about human beings, our abilities, or our place in the scheme of things, has not fared well in the light of evidence and understanding. This will not, however, kill the debate. The Mystics will always find something else on which to focus.

"Psionics/psychics/telepaths like Jean Grey, Professor X in SF books","Hi all. So I love X-Men and my favourite types of character are the psionics (although love most types of superhero except the more banal ‘super strong’/Superman types). 

Are there any books out there which have a heavy psi focus? 

NB: I’m new to the genre and have read only a few of the basics (Consider Phlebas which I didn’t really ‘get’ but need to try again, and Children of Time which I LOVED). Have read some epic fantasy and lighter fantasy novels, but sci-fi daunts me a bit. I can cope with a longer book (reading Oathbringer right now) but need a lot of action/plot/pace. And prefer modern-ish novels (no good reason). I also like to get stuck into a completed series but also love reading a couple of books and enjoying the excitement, buzz and anticipation of current series. 

PS: apologies that comes across as a bit of a childish title/enquiry, but hopefully it makes sense. I prefer adult books (I’m a 35 year old doctor - psychiatrist if anyone’s interested, so the themes are very slightly adjacent to my professional life haha...) rather than YA but don’t mind those too.","Psionics/psychics/telepaths like Jean Grey, Professor X in SF books Hi all.

The Nine Stories in [H.W. Taylor’s debut collection Progeny](https://imgur.com/E1LSPSe) are pure science fiction, mixing transcendence with hard science to concoct classic tales of xenophobia, love and time.

[“Immanence”](https://imgur.com/QVe8V56) is a story of loss in deep space; an accident, a miracle. [“Eschaton”](https://imgur.com/2h3JKNl) is a Medieval horror that stretches into Eternity. A secret staircase is stumbled upon by a boy exploring his strange new house and he can't help but exploring.[“Seed”](https://imgur.com/rVxgAHd) is about a hero on a distant journey to save his planet, whose enormous sacrifice is rendered useless by better technology.

[“Tendril”](https://imgur.com/juFAlN3)tells the story of a broken man in the shadow of an alien ship that refuses to acknowledge the planet below. [“Capricornus”](https://imgur.com/rs10QZK) is the report of a xenologist on a brutal battle that occurs under his watch. [“Into Your Hands”](https://imgur.com/bBx6trL) follows a father and son into the dangerous waters of the archipelago in an alien rites of passage tale.

[“Libidaurum”](https://imgur.com/wpjnROb) focuses on the extents to which a man of modern science will go to transform himself in order to explore a harsh and unforgiving planet. [“Future Sex”](https://imgur.com/3DLI2EL) is a hilarious tale about a wife whose husband’s time-travelling complicates the bedroom. And finally [“Love Bugs”](https://imgur.com/jItRTbu) tells the tale of political intrigue and an inter-species marriage and betrayal.

"[SPS] Continuum Force - Chapter 4 - Pax Romana, Pt. 1","**\[Sci-Fi/Time Travel/History/Ancient Aliens\] Continuum Force Chapter 4 - Pax Romana, Pt. I**

**Episode Summary:**  The Continuum Force discovers who was behind the attack on Apollo 13 and of treachery at home. The revealed foe wreaks havoc in Ancient Rome.

**What is Continuum Force?**

Basically? Its a full cast audio drama Stargate meets Ancient Aliens meets Doctor Who.

**What the heck is Audio Drama?**

Well, it's like an audio book, but it has sound effects and a full-cast (more than one actor doing the voices). It's meant to immerse you in the story. Think of the old War of the Worlds with Orson Welles or the Shadow broadcasts. It's like that, but modern, in today's age. Best of all, most are completely free (including ours).

MIRI: The Story -- science fiction with rocks,"My Dear Friends, if you are looking for a little sci-fi and humor, I am offering my novelette for free until April. You can find it on a few marketplaces (less Amazon), and I hope you will enjoy reading it. It should be free on itunes, scribd, smashwords and a lot of other sites if you search the title in quotation marks. Please let me know if it’s not yet free in your market (Country).

 

""MIRI: The Story"" will Not immerse the readers into a battle with plasma cannons depleting energy shields right from the start. In fact it features no space wars among the living beings. 

 

It begins by telling the story of a young person going through a day which progressively worsens. The decorations are supposed to be around the 2000s (Common Era) when Moe is kidnaped (no worries, he escapes) to be tortured (escapes before that) for information regarding some advanced technology, and so he is on the run. Yes, there are Cops.

&amp;#x200B;

The hero is helped by a free citizen to stay low and investigate the whole affair he has no prior knowledge about. They look for clues, talk to people and decide to confront the main villain, but no, no, no: he wakes up in a spaceship beaten by rocks (meteoroids), and this is where the second part begins... 

so please read my story, please :)","MIRI: The Story -- science fiction with rocks My Dear Friends, if you are looking for a little sci-fi and humor, I am offering my novelette for free until April.

Let’s talk about Nightflyers [spoilers],"With the cancellation of nightflyers and me finally finishing the last episode I need to get a few things off my chest spoilers obviously: 

Firstly the theme tune was top notch in fact the whole soundtrack was brilliant but that theme tune one of my favourites.
It had some really good sci fi moments, the probe/human hybrid, the porting into a virtual mainframe (very cyberpunk), the style of the ship and its habitat domes . 
They had some good premises but not all executed in the best manner really which brings me onto a big problem this show had -pacing- the pacing was all over the place the first half of the series was stopping the mother and then the other half was all about telepaths and not much of the finding alien life. It needed a clearer way of straightening these themes and making them parallel instead of a stop start method. I enjoyed this show but I was so confused in a lot of parts and that random episode of the other ship in the middle. Yes I get what it was trying to say about how dangerous it is out there in the void but it just came out of nowhere and was an odd tangent in the way of the story, I loved the premise but again it’s the pacing it put it somewhere it made no sense to put it. 
  The characters are an odd point as well some I liked some I didn’t care for unlike the expanse each characters feels well written. I loved rowans character he went from a funny background character to this man wrought with loss so fast and so heartbreaking that I knew why he snapped, he was interesting much like Lommie this woman who came from a cult essentially that banned technology for her to rebel and lose her family because of it was nicely explored and I was wanting to know more. Thale was also a good example of an interesting character he was someone shunned away from society because of what he could do and never really understood these types of characters I wanted more time with. Now some of the other characters just came off as boring and sometimes quite frankly useless, the big example Mel, she barely did anything apart from sleep with two people and complain most of the time, nothing was explained of her character I mean what was thing she was in, the tube from the first half of the season why was she in it and the whole sleeping with her genetic brother (what is with George. R. R. Martin and the incest?) I didn’t care what happened to this character she was very boring. Now D’brannin he seemed interesting by his drive but he seemed very generic (maybe partly from the actor I don’t know) but I like Mel I didn’t care for them when they were on screen. 
  As for some of the crew it felt weird sometimes it felt like the Nightflyer was a full bristling ship then other times it was like it was only filled with the main characters, the crew just seemed to disappear or just cease to exist like the guards/military or the other science crew that threw me off they only seemed to exist to serve a purpose mainly to die but a lot of the time never seemed to be in the background doing their day to day. The technology seems weird too like they could do ship wide calls but a lot of the time when it felt like it was needed like when D’brannin’s quarters was losing oxygen they forgot it existed, this goes well with the crew disappearing there was no random crew member helping or something, or when the spider robot started killing there were no other scientists or guards checking up on the people in that room. 
 The last three episodes did have me hooked and especially the last one with the 2001 feel to it: the red room like Hal’s mainframe, the killer computer, the ride in the escape pod through space and changing colour. I was still confused at times but I feel again that was a pacing issue and things being added to the story either at the wrong time or shouldn’t have been added in at all. In the end I liked the show it was some nice science fiction and would I want another season: yeah it would be nice to see what happened to the crew of the night flyer but they really need to fix that pacing and kind of Star Trek explain a few things especially some technologies. It’s a shame it got cancelled but I can see why it was not everybody’s cup of tea

Their description:

"" **The Latinx SFF Bundle**, curated by Silvia Moreno-Garcia: Latin American science fiction and fantasy occupy an odd in-between space. The commercial categories we denominate fantasy, science fiction and horror don't traditionally exist in Latin America. Instead, the fantastical is either simply called literature or receives the moniker of magical realism.  


This means finding speculative fiction is trickier and more complex in this part of the world. It also means that Latinx authors may derive their SFF canon from a very different well than their Anglo counterparts. While science fiction and fantasy are normally associated with Tolkien or Asimov, a Latinx writer might be more inclined to think of Isabel Allende or Julio Cortázar. At the same time, it is not unusual for Latinx authors to have also been exposed to Anglo pop culture, fantasy and science fiction. Finally, since Latin America is a large region, the history, culture and folklore of Latinx writers may be radically different from one another.  


The result is a wild, eclectic field of the fantastic, which is reflected by the selections in this bundle. ""

That moment when a friend reaches a major plot point for the first time...,"I am quite old. Many years ago, I became hooked on Julian May's *Saga of the Exiles* series and, in due course, her *Galactic Milieu* (GM) series. In fact, with regards to the latter, I basically fell in love. No-one else I know has read them.

GM is four books, set between the 1940s and the 2100s, and it's effectively a history of the Remillard family as told by Rogatien (Rogi) Remillard, as he writes their biography. Over the course of 4 novels, the human race develop mind powers (metafunctions) and we become part of a wider galactic federation of five 'coadunate' races. All our environmental problems are solved overnight by the exotics, and we get access to the stars and other planets on which to live and grow. There are - of course - serpents hiding within this amazing Eden, both within and outside the Remillard family.

I have never been able to talk about my excitement at discovering plot points, or different theories relating to who is the arch-baddy (their identity is hidden for a long time): I don't want to spoil the plot for those who haven't read the books and, frankly, why would non-readers care anyway? The frustration of wanting to talk about something that can never be discussed has always been with me, like a permanent low-grade toothache. Finally, after years of cajoling, I managed to convince my eldest son to read the GM novels.

So now we arrive here: recently he's been reading Book 3 (of 4) and, as things have progressed, he's been messaging me. I then get this from him at gone midnight:

&gt; I just finished Diamond Mask.
&gt;
&gt; Fuck

Oh my god, I am so happy!","That moment when a friend reaches a major plot point for the first time... I am quite old.

Ryan Moore jr. 

(2025- 2119)



Ryan leaned up from his seat and took a sharp sip of tea from his travel mug. As he looked out the window he had seen nothing but pitch black for several minutes now. He thought about how far the train had traveled and where him and the hundreds of other passengers where at the moment. Though the blackness of the tunnel gave little clue to Ryan he was amazed when he looked at the little heads up on display on the window pane, 350 kilometers per hour he thought, the nearly frictionless travel of a train really made newton's second law evident.
   


   Mere seconds later the darkness of the tunnel broke and the signal for the intercom came on at the front of the lounge car, “San Bernardino junction in 3 minutes” chimed the automated conductors voice. In the following seconds Ryan began to notice the train begin to gently decelerate as he felt pushed back into his seat. 
Looking out from the lounge car’s high windows he could see a proverbial urban forest. in Front of arid hills in the distance. Ryan gazed out over the vast urban sprawl of greater LA. This was not the city he remembered as a little kid. This new city of angels had experienced a population boom in the aftermath of the market crash in 33, since the tidal wave of reforms and reconstructions as part of a green new deal the population of greater LA had ballooned to nearly 40 million. Along with a great increase in non-automated jobs the population of the city had greatly densified in recent years as the once only industrial zoned areas in the south of the city were converted to residential. It now looked less like the LA of his early childhood and more like an analogue of Shanghai or Nanjing where the desert met the sea. Forests of towering high rise apartment buildings and corporate offices all coated in tinted glass and concrete intermixed with swarms of drones and sky-taxis delivering people and goods from A to B, like some great urban beehive.
 

   Ryan’s fascination was however broken by the trains eventual halt at the station. There was two more stops on the sun belt express line before Ryan reached his ultimate destination, One at Rancho Cucamonga and then it was over to LA union station, where this leg of the journey would terminate in about twenty five minutes. Ryan had never gone a day without talking to Aaron on video, after all they were twins and that bond was too tight to ever be forgotten or ignored. But he hadn’t seen him in the flesh for almost a year, because of this Aaron felt joyous at the prospect of getting to see Aaron for the first time in such a long stretch, it appeared that work may have gotten the best of them for a while at least.
 


   As the train pulled away from San Bernardino Ryan got an ever wider look at America’s favorite megalopolis. Giant green space park coora doors adorned with LA’s signature towering palms had replaced some of the lesser streets as they weaved through the forest of high rise office buildings, apartments and co-ops. For Ryan it was amazing to think that just 40 years ago LA was known as having some of the worst traffic in the world. Cars, Metrokab’s, Ubers and lame old city busses however were still quite visible however, but efficeney favored much of the smaller thoroughfares go underground since digging tunnels had become far cheaper nowadays after power prices plummeted.
 


   After the brief pittstop in San Bernardino, the Sun Belt express zipped along the track to the arguably less grand station at Rancho Cucamonga and finally under one more tunnel as the train finally came to a halt at LA union station. It had taken a solid two and a half hours from Phoenix, but Ryan finally carolled his roller bag from overhead storage and made his way to the lounge cars platform exit door.
 


   Ryan emerged under an array of massive curved tinted glass panels of LA union’s main high speed platform, despite it being mid-november it was bordering 28 degrees on this particular afternoon, anticipating the lower angle of the sun Ryan put his sunglasses on. LA Union was a mess at this time of day, masses of Angelinos waiting to greet their family members, business partners, friends or dates. Many held up floral bouquets or even hand written signs directing people to find who they planned to meet. There were also the ever annoying, skytaxi scalpers. They would sell you a fake or copied sky taxi pass for terminals on top of random nearby buildings, but there would only be a 30% chance of you being able to get on because it would be copied, and even if you did get on some poor bastard was cheated out of a 120 dollars and had to either complain to Uber or Verti or take the loss.
 


   Ryan quickly made his way up a footbridge over the waiting trains, but still under the terminals glass canopy, then through the beautifully preserved part of the old LA union station and out onto the sidewalk, he was thinking of picking up an Uber or a Metrokab when his fold buzzed. Ryan looked down at his watch. There on the screen scrolled a notification from venmo with a note, “$ 135.00, Hops on me, leaves at 15:50 leaves from top of Union building, see you in a sec champ. Ryan was ecstatic, he had always wanted to ride a sky taxi, but often found himself shrugging it off, a little self driving cab did indeed take longer for a journey of a few miles, but was less than a quarter the cost, but with Aaron paying for his little joy-ride he might as well give it a go.                     
   


   Ryan walked along the outside of the union station to the big Uber sign at the bottom of an external elevator leading up to the roof of the Union Stations administration building. Him as well as about a dozen other more affluent looking travelers got in the elevator as it’s electric pulley system whooshed them up to the top. Ryan had seen sky taxis flying around phoenix but in the roughly 15 years since they had became popular had never ridden one. The terminal occupied the entire roof the the building, there were 8 landing pads flanking the edge of the buildings otherwise plain looking roof with giant uber logos painted in the center on the circular landing pads.
 


   As ryan walked over to the terminal check in, the time on his wrist pad read 15:46, thank god he thought Aaron won’t be pissed that I missed his flying welcome matt. A boy not much older than 17 (probably a part time high school job) greeted the dozen or so passengers and scanned either their wrist pads or their folded communicators. The boy signed for Ryan and about 5 others to go to the nearest landing pad on their left. The sky taxi looked kind of like a mix between a drone and an sleekr version old city bus, with large windows on the side to give passengers a good view during the short flight. It had footpads for landing gear as well as a fairly nondescript tube shaped passenger compartment with narrow frontal winglets and wider wings on the back that each supported a large ducted fan on its end.
   


   Ryan carried his backpack and roller bag and sat down on the first of eight or so seats, he stored his luggage underneath and strapped his seatbelt over his shoulder. “Vermont street sky terminal, ETA 3 minutes, 15 seconds” chirped the lovely synthetic voice of the intercom. Ryan held onto the armrest as the sky taxi began to ascend only about a minute after he sat down. Upon rising to an altitude of several hundred meters, Ryan met with an amazing view. He looked over at downtown LA, he could see several of the newer skyscrapers towering over the old US bank tower, as well as the endless forest of high rise apartments and corporate buildings to the south north east and west, he saw world famous dodgers stadium to his right as well as Santa Monica and the endless pacific to his left. Soon enough the engines of the taxi tilted to the horizontal and the taxi began to fly forward, though it didn’t look fast from over 500 meters it was quite speedy. Soon enough the engines rotating back to the vertical position and the taxi landed on top of some nondescript office building overlooking the corner of vermont and sunset, near the metro station. Ryan and the five or so other passengers quickly descended the external elevator onto the street below. 



   Ryan had landed in the eastern part of hollywood, an area mostly free from the celebrity driven drama and tackiness of the main part. It was friday and that meant crowds of young people walking about with their friends to go get a bite to eat and perhaps a drink. Ryan wandered through the crowded sidewalk as he made his way down Sunset blvd. Masses of cars traveled down sunsets wide corridor, arranging themselves and communicating to make trips as efficient as possible. They resembled a colony of ants working in unison to pull off some task greater than any individual ant. Ryan then crossed the street to get over to Aaron's building, It was truly a bizarre yet special piece of real estate. It wasn't barely a third the height of many of the glass and concrete towers that surrounded that forested that area of hollywood, and more bizarre still the whole thing was painted a rich shade of blue. He was glad that his brothers residence was a easy to find as it was. The place had a bizarre history, and since he had moved in a little under a year ago, Aaron had many times told him the story of the building via video chat.



   About 90 prior, the church of scientology (one of America’s most infamous criminal cults) had bought the building and turned it into their international headquarters. Within the building countless people had been scammed out of their livelihood by the zelous followers of the bloated yellow toothed L. Ron Hubbard. In just under a century the church had managed to convince quite a few of hollywood's power players to convert only to be in a fierce battle to leave later on once they realized the manipulate and controlling nature of what they had signed onto. In the end the church had an impressive run of over 85 years, however in the aftermath of the financial crisis in the thirties, the church no longer had enough members to profit from it’s real estate empire. Combined with several well publicised FBI raids on their compounds for falsely imprisoning people and their leader being sent to prison for it, the church died, good riddance.

The Man Who Fell to Earth 1976. My Journey into Science-Fiction Part 11.,,The Man Who Fell to Earth 1976. My Journey into Science-Fiction Part 11. 
Pros and Cons of The 100,"I just finished watching Season 5 of The 100. It is an interesting show and I'd like to share my thoughts on its pros and cons.   


Let's first start with the positive things going for this show:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It keeps you interested because you don't know what will happen next.
   1. Will they find peace with the Grounders? Will they be saved form Mount Weather? What decisions will they make next?
2. It really makes you think about the choices we have to make and the ethics/morals behind those choices, as well as the consequences. 
   1. Sacrifice the few to save the many. 
   2. How do we save the ones we love?
3. We start off seeing through the eyes of followers (The 100) and how they react to the decision of leaders (Jaha and Cain), but the followers soon become the leaders and have to make the tough decisions; ""walk in my shoes for a day""
4. It doesn't sugar coat or apologize for the brutality and inhumane nature of the characters. 
   1. This show is riddled with torture, abuse, death, genocide, etc.   


And now for the cons:

1. The relationship between the characters. 
   1. The majority of the sex/romantic relationships are pointless and do nothing to bolster the characters or move the story forward. It is forced. 
   2. It's annoying to see them get saved simply because ""they are friends"" or ""they are family"".
2. The main protagonists give you no reason to care about them. 
   1. Most of the time I was hoping they would die/get killed. The only characters I cared about were Lincoln, Octavia, and Jasper. Lincoln was by far the most likable, and best character on the show. Octavia became an evil dictator in Season 5 (was hoping she'd be killed). Jasper lost his mind after Mount Weather, but realized an important truth in the end (The cycle of violence never ends)  ----- He chose to live his last days happy and not in fear; he chose to live, not just survive. 
3. They constantly rejected the path to peace: torturing and killing the innocent, The City of Light, becoming the 13th clan, constant betrayal.
   1. I understand they need these conflicts to keep the story going, but again, this makes me not care whether or not they live or die. 
4. Too many things make no sense at all. 
   1. They were only in space for 97 years, yet an entirely new language, culture, and customs arise? It's as though the inhabitants of Earth who survived were nothing like the people in space. 
   2. Jaha heard about the City of Light from a woman in the desert (the dead zone), yet when he reached it there were no people. The people in the desert were outcasts due to birth defects, but how did they know anything about the City of Light if the city didn't exist and there were no people there?
   3. Cars operate without fuel and need little to no maintenance? 
   4. Grounders use spears, swords, knives, bows and arrows but there are working guns on the ground? 
   5. Was there manufacturing in space in order to create and build new parts, medicines, food, maintenance, etc?
   6. And so many more

Overall, I did enjoy this show, but I was not emotionally invested in the characters and was annoyed with the lack of ethics/morality in the show. There were no ""good guys"" to root for; except maybe Lincoln.   


Season 5 was not very good and I'm not really interested in a Season 6. ","Pros and Cons of The 100 I just finished watching Season 5 of The 100. It is an interesting show and I'd like to share my thoughts on its pros and cons.   


Let's first start with the positive things going for this show:

&amp;#x200B;

1. It keeps you interested because you don't know what will happen next.
   1. Will they find peace with the Grounders? Will they be saved form Mount Weather? What decisions will they make next?
2. It really makes you think about the choices we have to make and the ethics/morals behind those choices, as well as the consequences. 
   1. Sacrifice the few to save the many. 
   2. How do we save the ones we love?
3. We start off seeing through the eyes of followers (The 100) and how they react to the decision of leaders (Jaha and Cain), but the followers soon become the leaders and have to make the tough decisions; ""walk in my shoes for a day""
4. It doesn't sugar coat or apologize for the brutality and inhumane nature of the characters. 
   1. This show is riddled with torture, abuse, death, genocide, etc.   


And now for the cons:

1. The relationship between the characters. 
   1. The majority of the sex/romantic relationships are pointless and do nothing to bolster the characters or move the story forward. It is forced. 
   2. It's annoying to see them get saved simply because ""they are friends"" or ""they are family"".
2. The main protagonists give you no reason to care about them. 
   1. Most of the time I was hoping they would die/get killed. The only characters I cared about were Lincoln, Octavia, and Jasper. Lincoln was by far the most likable, and best character on the show. Octavia became an evil dictator in Season 5 (was hoping she'd be killed). Jasper lost his mind after Mount Weather, but realized an important truth in the end (The cycle of violence never ends)  ----- He chose to live his last days happy and not in fear; he chose to live, not just survive. 
3. They constantly rejected the path to peace: torturing and killing the innocent, The City of Light, becoming the 13th clan, constant betrayal.
   1. I understand they need these conflicts to keep the story going, but again, this makes me not care whether or not they live or die. 
4. Too many things make no sense at all. 
   1. They were only in space for 97 years, yet an entirely new language, culture, and customs arise? It's as though the inhabitants of Earth who survived were nothing like the people in space. 
   2. Jaha heard about the City of Light from a woman in the desert (the dead zone), yet when he reached it there were no people. The people in the desert were outcasts due to birth defects, but how did they know anything about the City of Light if the city didn't exist and there were no people there?
   3. Cars operate without fuel and need little to no maintenance? 
   4. Grounders use spears, swords, knives, bows and arrows but there are working guns on the ground? 
   5. Was there manufacturing in space in order to create and build new parts, medicines, food, maintenance, etc?
   6. And so many more

Overall, I did enjoy this show, but I was not emotionally invested in the characters and was annoyed with the lack of ethics/morality in the show. There were no ""good guys"" to root for; except maybe Lincoln.

I personally just found it to be a breath of fresh air.

Is This Concept Possible Or Not?,"I have always wanted to build a machine that is able to extract a certain number of subatomic particles from other atoms and combine them into a separate atom with the right amount of protons and neutrons. If that's confusing let me explain it this way.

For example, the atomic number of gold is 79, meaning its nucleus contains 79 protons; no more, no less. Now, pretend that one atom over here has an atomic number of 50, which is the atomic number of tin, and one over there has an atomic number of 29. The machine would extract the 50 protons from the first one, and then extract the 29 protons from the other one and combine them into an individual nucleus with 79 protons. For the neutrons, the machine would do the same thing. It would then form a gold atom, and it would continue this process and make more gold atoms until there are enough to form the object that you want out of gold.

Now, one flaw that you might have noticed is the fact that the machine would have to extract protons and neutrons from other atoms to be able do this whole process. Does ""extracting"" a proton or a neutron (as I called it) count as ""splitting"" an atom? Would it cause an atomic explosion??? I don't really want to find out... lol

Now, one flaw that you might have noticed is the fact that the machine would have to extract protons and neutrons from other atoms to be able do this whole process. If any of you guys are even remotely familiar with chemistry, you probably know of the phenomenon that occurs when an atom is ""split,"" causing an atomic explosion. Now, when we say that the atom gets split, does that mean that the subatomic particles get split along with the atom, or does it mean one or more subatomic particles getting separated from the others? I don't know if I said that correctly, but I hope I did, and I look forward to getting an answer from one of you guys.

Has any scifi dystopia managed to remove conscious thought from its citizens/victims?,"Brave New World has their mass-produced clone citizens divided into castes and the lower castes were deliberately stunted in mental development to make them better suited to their jobs. 1984 had the idea of removing words from the language so that rebellion and disobedience would be unthinkable. But there's still that balance to be struck between having citizens intelligent enough to maintain a technological society but not so intelligent they recognize they're getting a raw deal. 

In real life we've seen the philosophers of dictatorships struggling with methods to maintain ideological control. Religions and states both desire control. A scifi setting can take it to the next level. 

I read a story a while back where a dystopian government induced a ""50 First Dates"" sort of amnesia in women to ensure docility. They have their memories up until they are married off and then they are given a treatment where no further long-term memories can be formed. They have a book they write for themselves they are supposed to read each morning with the relevant facts they need to know about their lives since marriage. That sort of thing would be a horrifying way to have labor that can't make long-term plans. It's inefficient, of course, but a hallmark of proper dystopias is the inefficient extremes they'll go for the sake of absolute control. Something similar was done in the Man-Kzin Wars setting. The Kzin had bred intelligence out of their females because they thought it unnecessary which then led to an interesting story where a colony of stone age Kzin are encountered along with thinking females. They were not too happy when they discovered what their spaceborne cousins had done. 

The worst extreme of this I can imagine is if there were a way to obliterate conscious thought while allowing workers to perform their necessary functions. Sort of like a perpetual sleep walking state where a worker is conscious enough to follow orders and perform tasks but without self-awareness, without higher forms of conscious thought. Incapable of even knowing he is a slave because he is incapable of even knowing himself. 

I could have sworn I'd heard something like this in a scifi setting but I can't find it. The closest I can find is when there's some sort of puppeteer race mind-controlling humans and so they're basically just zombified agents of the overmind. The Borg would basically fall into this category. ","Has any scifi dystopia managed to remove conscious thought from its citizens/victims?

What's the name of that game...,"What's the name of that game that:

1. Not those AAA games.

3. Psychological sci-fi thriller set in a dystopian setting.
4. An entity of artificial intelligence controls the world. A supercomputer of some sort.
5. The only survivors are 3 men and 1 woman. One of the man resembles an ape/orangutan. The woman is often regarded as a sex object.
6. The gameplay is to explore the four survivors' deepest nightmares (or something) in order to beat the AI/finish the game/something something
7. Eventually the survivors learn the AI cannot be defeated, thus falling back to the same cycle of reliving their own nightmares.

Is Dune really a si-fi?,"I recently read the “three body problem trilogy by Cixin Liu”(the best scifi I have ever read) thanks to this subreddit recommendations.
And many of you guys recommended the Dune as the legendary novel of sci-fi, so with my anticipation high, I read the novel.

To me, the novel should be considered as fantasy. I mean, the character’s supernatural powers doesn’t really fit into the ‘science’ catagory.
Those who love Dune, no offence. Mabe it’s because I just read the first book. And mabe Cixin Liu and Frank Herbert’s writing style is so different that I’m not getting used to it.

Questions about the Wandering Earth (contains spoilers),"Hi.  I missed a few things when watching the movie so I have a few questions (my questions contain spoilers so please stop reading if you don't want to be spoiled):

1. Why did earth get caught in Jupiter's gravity pull?  Why did the thrusters for earth shut off to allow earth to get caught in Jupiter's gravity pull?

2. At the Sulawesi thruster, what exactly was Liu Qi (the son of Liu Peiqiang) trying to do? Was he trying to install the new core into the thruster?

3. At the Sulawesi thruster, what were the three of them pushing?  A bunch more people help to push in the end.  What were they pushing and why did they need to push it?

4. If the space station had enough gas stored on it to trigger the explosion on Jupiter's red spot, was the extension of the thruster really needed?

5. Did they mention how they grew food since the surface was too cold to grow any food?  

The next two questions are more science oriented:

6. What is that vapor trail flowing from the earth as it is travelling through space?  Is that the earth's atmosphere being lost to space?  If the earth's atmosphere and gases continue to be lost to space, how can the earth survive another 2500 years until the final destination?

7. Didn't they say they needed to travel at 0.5% the speed of light for the next 2500 years or so to reach the final destination? Wouldn't other problems arise if the earth started to travel at 0.5% the speed of light such as, it would start to gain a lot of mass (or does an object only gain mass at the speed of light but not slower than the speed of light)?

Really did not like Alita:Battle Angel,"Sucks because I love the manga. Hated the executions of all the changes they made.

&amp;#x200B;

Copied my review from another place 

"" 

**Alita: Battle Angel** is such an infuriating film that I am half convinced it’s just an elaborate **James Cameron** troll job.

Conceptually I LOVE everything about this movie but the final product…. Now before I go to negatives I gotta mention the good stuff.

The visuals are legit stunning. The film is a marvel to look at. In fact, all the technical work is great. The action scenes are pulse pounding and really well done. Additionally, **Rosa Salazar** is really good and makes the most of the script. She has the look and acts the hell out of her role. For the first two act’s the film had a little bit of flow.

Now that I am done with positives, it’s time to go into why this doesn’t work. **Alita: Battle Angel** always sets itself up for good stuff and Always falls flat on it’s face. **Yukito Kishiro’s** manga touches on all of the same themes and characters of the movie. The difference is that the manga actually engages with and explores them.

I could write a whole essay on why hardly anything works. I’ll just mention the highlights. First off, the characters do nothing to really make us care. Hugo is a perfect example of why this movie does not work. Embarrassing dialogue aside did anyone care when he died? He mentioned off hand twice he wanted to go to Zalem. Why do people care about his dream or him? His “character development” is awful writing where he just decides to not be a terrible person. Alita throws away all it’s themes. The overlapping idea of freedom is just so poorly handled and he is the personification of it. Like I mentioned above him wanting to escape to Zalem is never explored past him just stating it.

Cameron’s script can never dive into anything because the madman is trying to cram nearly 35 issues into a single movie. For perspective Watchmen which had to cut tons of stuff out was 12 issues. The script is just awful. The dialogue is terrible, the romance is complete garbage and some things feel so unnecessary. Why did Zapan even need to be in the movie besides setting up his story for the sequel? He only exists to be important in one scene. Could have easily been written out, saved us 10 minutes and nothing really changes. So many terrible conversatiosn that could be cut down or cut entirely. Also prepare for student level exposition dumps. Maybe twice in the whole movie is information revealed in a good manner. This is Alita but dumbed down to be another generic blockbuster franchise. Joke of a script. Cameron clearly loves the source but has no idea how to trim it into a single movie.

Our main character Alita fundamentally does not change much from the start of the movie. Everything good they set up for her isn’t explored. She is 300 years out of time and in a world, she doesn’t know. Don’t expect the movie to do anything with this past a few throwaway lines of her adjusting. Her past life on mars and examining what kind of person she wants to be now that she has the choice? You will have to wait for the sequel that is never happening. Ido’s relationship with her? Awful, it never goes anywhere. The way they view each other is the exact same from the beginning of the film. Ido learning to move on from his daughter? Nope. Also don’t expect her to ever be in danger. You literally never feel that she is in any real danger. I get her past is the in-world excuse but she is laughably better than everyone at everything. The ending of the movie skips so much character development. The fallout from the super traumatic event that just happened to her? Don’t expect to see how this shapes her as a person or how she deals with it. I was stunned that we never got to see her progress up the ranks of the motorball. We just skip to where she is the top dog and going to Zalem. For those that know the manga prepare to be pissed as the movie introduces the best bad guy/ champion of motorball, Jashugan. Jai Courtney plays him and is on screen as him for maybe 10 seconds. Again, Cameron just says ‘fuck you wait for the sequel”

**Alita: Battle Angel** third act is just as bad as you’ve been told. This can’t even be called a complete movie. That would require an ending. Almost nothing that is set up has any resolution. What is Nova’s goal? What is Alita’s true motive? Why is she on earth after all this time? The sequel set up is just embarrassing. I legit flipped off the screen as the credits started. We don’t even get to see the champion racer who is the best on earth race a single time.

Originally, I was going to give this a begrudging 3/5 because it was component ish. Then the third act happened. Would be curious to hear arguments that this is a good ending/ third act. Now before the “you just wanted the manga to be adapted” comments start coming in, let me assure you that is not true. Example, Nova’s role isn’t really like the manga and I was super interested to see where his story was going…but the movie never engages with him. They just tell us to wait for the sequel. All the changes on paper sound super cool but Rodriguez and Cameron never do anything with them. Coming out I was thinking that maybe Alita fans could find something out of it, but no. This movie is a bad adaptation of its source material and an awful movie on its own merits.

A slog that can't end fast enough.""","Really did not like Alita:Battle Angel Sucks because I love the manga. Hated the executions of all the changes they made.

Self Promo Saturday: From Meth Junkie to International Bestseller,"Hello Reddit,

I am author, M. R. Mathias, and I am promoting myself. Thus the SPS post.

A couple decades ago I went to prison in Texas for possession of ecstasy. I got into a fistfight the second day I was in the system. It happened in the medical area, with civilian staff present, and I was put in solitary confinement. I was in the same cell alone for 16 months, and then I was moved to the cell next door, for the remaining 7 months of my 2 year sentence. 23 hour a day lock down. 3 showers a week. No TV, just a crappy radio and not nearly enough books. I had graduated H.S. with a scholarship in creative writing, but I never pursued it until I got locked up. While I was there I wrote *The Wardstone Trilogy* (+/- 700k pages) and the first four *The Legend of Vanx Malic* novels, all in longhand, with about 800 disposable pens on wide ruled notebook paper. I still have the longhand versions, even the colored pencil map I made.

Every word, on every page was, a moment of freedom I created for myself. Texas prison is a very violent, racial place. The subtle underlying theme of *Wardstone* is how conflicted fantasy races come together, overcoming their differences to defeat a common enemy. *The Legend of Vanx Malic*'s first four are in an omnibus called: *To Kill a Witch*. They won a few minor awards as a collection, mainly because one of the main character's best friends is a lesbian barbarian named Chelda. Keep in mind I wrote this pre 2008, before inclusion was cool. The primary thing about these seven books, that I hope will interest modern fantasy readers, is they were written before *Dances with Dragons* came out, and before I saw the *LOTR* movies, or even the newer *Starwars* trilogy, so those have no influence. At the time I was reading Tad Williams, Robert Jordan, Ursula K. Leguin, Robin Hobbs, Goodkind, Weis and Hickman, and my all time favorite, Raymond E. Feist.

I first self-published, *The Sword and the Dragon* in 2010. The only reason I had the opportunity to enter it all into a computer was because I chose to take care of my Grandmother, who had Alzheimer's. It made Fantasy Book Critic's Top 10 Indies of 2010 list, alongside Michael J. Sullivan's then titled book: *Wintertide*. As I learned to type and transferred the other longhand behemoths into word, I found myself suddenly making money via Kindle and Nook and Sony. Sony? Yes, they had ereaders before there was Kindle. In fact my whole run at the top of the charts happened as KDP was coming into its own. And this is why you might have never heard of me, even though I was #1 in all of Fantasy/Mythology and top ten of all authors in the Amazon store for the better part of a year. But that was before there were author follow buttons, before author services were advertised on every website, and before any forum mod on the internet had an ounce of respect for indie authors.

Anyway, I wrote *The Dragoneer Saga* while transcribing *Wardstone* and book one, *The Royal Dragoneers*, was nominated for the Locus Poll. That was cool, even though I didn't win. And the six book *Dragoneer Saga* went on to win several minor awards for both individual books, and the second trilogy omnibus.

I guess the real point of my introduction is to say my books are not the formula based clones you find everywhere these days. I am not some dreamer trying to make it big. In fact I make my living off of my novels and have since 2010. I write under my real name. And so far, after almost 70 publications, I maintain over a 4 star review average at Amazon and Goodreads, after well over ten thousand reviews.

I hope my story interests you. I was once a meth junkie with more holes in my arms than pennies in my pocket. I have been free and clean since I got out. I am married and helping raise two boys. I am proof that there is life after meth and prison. And my kids hope you go buy a bunch of my books, because they want to go to college. lol

Seriously, the 16 year old told me to say that.

Since the above mentioned books, and my run at the top of the charts, my Grandmother died, and my mother had terminal Cancer. I was busy with that for a while, and my internet presence faded. Now I am back with two new completed series. Fantastica is an epic 4 book fantasy tale about a young man who finds something powerful, and ends up with an unjust bounty on his head. Blah, blah, blah.... Look it up, if you are interested. Book One is called Taerak's Void, and I think it is just a buck.

My other new series is called Dragon Racers. It is a trilogy, and my first attempt at ""clean"" all-ages fantasy. I mean none of my books have gratuitous sex, but swords are messy, and so are teeth and claws. I'm in love with the tag line they come up with for Dragon Racer 1, and I am happy that several moms have given it the ""all-ages"" approval.

""If you like feisty heroines, fearsome dragons, and fast-paced action, then you'll love M. R. Mathias' steam-powered thrill-ride.""

So now you know a little about me and my author stuff. I hope one of my series interests you. I will list and link them below, not in an attempt to spam or even advertise, but simply for your convenience.

Thanks for your time, Redditers. I appreciate it.

But I would love to sell some books and I am told I wrote a good one. It is available through Amazon where so far it has 5 out 5 stars.  Below is a sample review from a very kind reader.

This book was cleverly and creatively written. Though many stories have been told and written about Bigfoot, this book finds a completely different perspective from which to view this legendary creature.
Joe Dano has been searching for Bigfoot for many years, but when Oma (Bigfoot) chooses to appear to him, Joe finds him to be an intelligent and intriguing creature. There is a history, intention, and depth of intelligence to him that is unexpected.

Mortal Engines - Is there any logic?,"I never read the books, and I only watched 3/4 of the movie before I buckled.  


I just want to ask anyone that actually read the books to explain me, and tell me if there is any logic. For what I have seen is opposite to logic. Just a disclaimer - dont say its Fantasy - therefore its possible. Even in fantasy things have logic and work in confines of their own setting. And Sci-Fi is based on science, at least of scientific logic. That being said...  


1. The film says there was kind of atomic war that caused huge earthquakes, tsunamis..etc. And they solved it with making cities on wheels ? What ?! How can that except being decade long work (even if it was possible ) save anything ? 
2. In the film the world looks completely livable. Why are they in still in those stupid cities ?
3. What are they eating ? Would agriculture not be easier on land ?
4. The cities eat other cities for resources ?! Seeing that cities are made of stone, metal, wood - would simple mining be easier ? Even during apocalypse ?
5. Anti gravity powered air ships ? Nice. Didnt you think of flying cities ?
6. Is there anything in that film that makes logic. And how books make it work ?","Mortal Engines - Is there any logic? I never read the books, and I only watched 3/4 of the movie before I buckled.

What is this movie/episode/short called?,"Im looking for a movie or episode or short with this plot.

A man makes a robot. He is somehow indebted to the mob/mafia. He makes the robot in the image of his late wife. The robot is self aware. The mob plans to use the robot as a prostitute but then figures that they can get the robot to carry out their hits. The robot doesnt want to be a slave and kills the mob guys, the robot also doesnt want to be a replacement wife for her creator and kills him too. The last sceen is a news anchor reporting on the recent murders.

I wish i could remember anything more than that. Its not an older movie though probably made within the last 10 years.","What is this movie/episode/short called? Im looking for a movie or episode or short with this plot.

Searching for short story about a robot protecting a human child after the apocalypse. The Last Human.,"Hi everyone. 

I just saw some new that Phil Lord and Chris Miller are directing an adaptation of an upcoming book called The Last Human by Lee Bacon. The synopsis reads:
&gt; Set after a robot apocalypse, when humans have been extinct for 30 years. The story follows a 12-year-old robot, XR_935, who is happy to live in a world without crime, pollution or war. One day, XR discovers a human, Emma, who is also 12 years old, but has spent her entire life inside an underground bunker, hidden away from machines. Emma and XR form an unlikely friendship, and, with two other robotic companions, embark on a dangerous voyage in search of a mysterious point on a map, a journey that will require them to break all of the rules while also challenging ideas of prejudice.

This entire thing reminds me of a short story I read on here years ago. The only clue I've found leads to this locked sub:
https://www.reddit.com/r/thelasthuman/
Which I do believe contains what I'm after. I would love to read it again, if anyone have any way to do so. ","Searching for short story about a robot protecting a human child after the apocalypse. The Last Human. Hi everyone.

The rusty sunset ( in honour of Opportunity Rover),"The white bright sun is slowly sinking behind the far crimson mountain, scattering the last bits of its warm light all over the rusty rocks around me.  I still remember the first time I tasted its ultraviolet flavoured rays spreading against my screens. It felt real and special, much better than the boring simulations in NASA. 


I gathered the last bits of energy still flowing in my power lines, and barely climbed over a small pebble. Back in my first days, I’d jump the highest rocks with the least bit of care, but fifteen years is not a short time, and I can feel fatigue straining against my axes, causing me a strange feeling when I try to move. A feeling I lack enough intelligence to explain, but I can guess it’s what humans call pain.
 The sun is running down faster, and I still didn’t get the energy I need. I’m pushing myself to the highest spot, struggling to turn my screens towards her, but all in vain. 


“ My batteries are low” 


I hate to send these messages. Vandi always gets upset when she receives them, and I don’t want her to be sad. She guided me through the toughest times. My memory cards are already crumbling with all this rusty dust accumulating inside me throughout the long weary years, but I still clearly remember the joy I felt in the commands when she was driving me. They will tell you that a robot can’t feel, but believe me, I do, and I always felt happy when I got those commands from her. 


I wish I didn’t have to send this message, but it’s my duty to inform. Poor Vandi. She would be worried. I remember the last time I sent her this message. She tried everything she could to stay in touch with me. I vaguely remember her commands, her begging and her prayers, but I do remember the joy when I finally recharged, and sent her the awesome view of the rusty sunset down the valley. The final rays of sunshine are fading away. I’m running with all my remaining power, but I’m too weak to move, and I feel the pain crushing my inner joints. 


I’m tired. 


I wish I can reach the sun before my batteries die. I know I’m very old already. I know I won’t be able to do all these cool tests that make Vandi happy anymore. I’m too crushed and bruised to jump on the craters and run between the huge rocks. But all I want is to sit there, on the top of the small cliff, to enjoy the lovely sunsets every night, and send Vandi a “Good Morning” every time I feel the slight warmth of the big yellow star after a long freezing night. 


It’s getting dark. I can feel the chilling wind booing around me. I feel very cold. My very last drops of power are leaving my rusty damaged body. I just hope I made my humans proud. I hope I was a good robot. I hope one day they will come for me, and I will be watching the beautiful sunset with Vandi again.

Help finding a movie,"Hi there,

I was on the train near a dude watching a sci fi film on his computer. It looked really compelling but I couldn't catch a glimpse of what film it was... Maybe one of you will know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I only caught the end of it, it had a small crew, maybe as low as 2 people exploring what looked like an alien ship or something. Anyway the main feature was that it was all white, looked like feathers, they find someone on some kind of pedestal covered in the white stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need your help (Story ID),"Back when I was younger I read a story inside a ""award winning scifi stories book"", which I can't remember the publisher nor the name of the story itself

It happened in an elevator, which stopped every now and then in a tower's different levels, always going up. Inside the elevator were a few different characters, one of them was a military guy, then there was another guy, a woman and some more.

The story itself was short but I remember a pregnant woman giving birth and all the floors being human-free, the only people in the story were the people in the elevator. Someone makes a calculation in the end and counts the total floors of the tower, getting to the conclusion that the tower is infinite or something like that

I read it in spanish originally, so it could be a translation of a original story

Looking for a book I read a long time ago,Actually looking for a few books.  First book a person kills someone and as such is sent to another place.  He is trained to be a soldier.  he wore a suit that as I remember flowed over his body.  His gun reminded him of some pray action from his homeworld.  The aliens used his planet for cannon fodder in their intergalatic war.  Later in the book he and a group killed an alien and fled in a spaceship.  I would REALLY like to know the name and author of the book ,Looking for a book I read a long time ago Actually looking for a few books.

"Started ""The Forever War""...and it's not that good?","With high hopes and anticipation, I finally began reading Haldeman's ""The Forever War"".

This isn't about the story being dated or science fact nitpicking. Rather, it's stuff like making ""fighting suits"" without safety mechanisms. Or having soldiers manually dig out structures *with weapons* when machines or a specialized engineering unit would make infinitely more sense. And the constant sex between soldiers? That's not how to run a tight ship.

In a specific instance, one soldier even gets his face slightly burnt by an ""overloaded"" view screen. I mean, come on, that's not how view screens work. And if they did, who the hell would design one that could pump out a damaging level of radiation right into your eyes?

I'm partially ranting because this much lauded book just strikes me as silly, but I also want to know what other people think. Anybody else see what I'm seeing?

Started watching LEXX - Something seems VERY odd to me.,"I'm enjoying the show but that's not the strange part. What is strange is that while Episode 2 has Zev totally naked in the shower for a minute or so, the rest of the show seems dead intend on NEVER allowing even a hint of a pantie shot which seems very hard for them to do with how short her dress is.

&amp;#x200B;

Now if there were no Nude scene, which really doesn't add anything to the story so I'm not sure WHY it is there other than to show Zev nude, I would assume this was just to try and be family friendly while still being sexy. But to have the editing like this AND have the nude scene seem juxtaposed.. 

I know that the show is not American, was there some kind of rules that said they COULD do a nude scene but NOT allowed to flash panties?

Looking for the name of a short story involving suicide and a classified ad,"I’m trying to find a story I read years ago - can’t remember where but I think it was one of the major SF magazines. I can’t remember anything about the title or author. But the basic premise is unforgettable.

It starts with a man contemplating suicide. He looks through the classifieds of his paper and comes across an ad that says something like “Depressed? Contemplating suicide? I can help. Call this number.” It sounds like a suicide hotline, but the big twist (which appears fairly early in the story) is that the ad was placed by a fetishist who literally wants to help the protagonist kill himself. And it goes downhill from there.

"INQUIRY: Which sci-fi(+ish) book series (Hyperion, etc) can be read partially?","TL;DR Some cycles start great but turn into crap, or are just unreasonably long (over three books). It would be nice to read just the good part without the luggage. Below there is a list of series I'm specifically curious about. If you read such series, share whether they can be enjoyed when read partially (e.g., 1 book of a trilogy), or are they written in a cliffhanger sort of way?

I think a universal map of ""painless exits"" will come in handy to many sci-fi readers, especially because there is a risk to see a spoiler if you try to Google such info, and it's inconvenient to ask the same question about every series one by one.

Rule #1: No spoilers please.

Rule #2. For it to be useful, name also series which you know to be ""inseparable"".

Many of (most of?) recommended sci-fi books are part of trilogy / tetralogy / 66-logy. Often the later books receive mixed or bad reviews, and even if they are good all the way though, I'm in a mood to read 12 different authors rather than 12 books by 2 authors.

So I would prefer to ditch the ship way before the six part, probably  after the first one, sometimes second one, but do it when it's organic, i.e., when book provides some completion.

There are cases when books in a series, or at least the first book in a series, have a fulfilling conclusion, like if they are standalone. Often it is because they were standalone and sequels were conceived later.

If we use movies as an example, that would be Terminator and Terminator 2. Or The Matrix - at the end of the first movie the story is clearly not over, but you experienced a great journey and picked up some ideas, you are satisfied.

[SPS] Hi! I've spent the last 8 months analyzing ethical themes of sci-fi films on my YouTube channel. My goal is to promote thoughtful and intelligent discussion in my favorite genre. Enjoy!,"Hi! My channel, [Space Taste](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkUnpn_vOog3Qve5EzL2bug), aspires to be a premier destination for intelligent and thoughtful discussion in the world of sci-fi and superheroes. I've worked extensively in the YouTube horror space and led the development of a 2M+ sub channel, but my true passion has and will always be sci-fi and superheroes. Beyond general pop culture analysis channels, there's a surprising lack of sci-fi on YouTube and I sincerely hope to change that. 

In addition to the ethics series, my partners and I also have three other video series formats that we've been with experimenting with: 

* [The Ethics of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPy3p8asrjA&amp;list=PLKchRfn-ll3l-bec4wyOiqSrYiVeLv7Ak) where we analyze the ethical themes of our favorite sci-fi films such as robotic policemen in Robocop and fabricated realities in The Truman Show. 
* [Geek mashup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F2I4xBtgwU&amp;t=120) where we fuse together iconic characters in timelapse art battles
* [E! True Hollywood parodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upKQySP2IhM) (but with superheroes)
* Trailer Recuts of iconic sci-fi and horror films. For example, [Gremlins if Mogwai turned into Ninja Turtles](https://youtu.be/iSmXHBm6IJo)

The production quality is top-notch as my editing partner is also a professional in the industry. I'd love any thoughts or feedback. My ultimate goal is to transition into original short films and motion comics once the content can pay for itself through sponsorships or Patreon. ","[SPS] Hi!

Starship Troopers-inspired video games,"After re-reading Heinleins book (I like the movie, it is still a parody/critique of the source material) I'm now desperatley craving for a movie or video game that would use similar aesthetics and themes (not in the W40k/Halo way of just copy-pasting space marines).

I’m 36 &amp; just finished Dune. It completely blew my mind.,"Hi everyone!! I literally just put the book down... I’ve been into scifi/high fantasy for a couple years now. I’ve read a bunch of modern stuff. Sanderson, Rothfuss, Butcher. This however, is my first time with anything considered ‘classic’. I can see why this book was so instrumental in shaping the genre into what it is today. A few thoughts:

1) I’ve got the next two books in the series, would y’all say there’s a stopping point or does the story play out through all of them (including the ones written by Herbert’s son? (Without researching I think it’s his son) 

2) I really enjoyed Herbert’s style. It took me a bit. But after a few chapters I found that I like the directness of the character’s thoughts. abs more straightforward style which, is new for me. Although I’m curious if that style continues in the rest of the series. 

3) I also felt like this story line is SO relevant for today. Like insanely so. I feel as though Muad’Dib is teetering on this fence of avoiding a jihad and whatever the plan seems to be from the Bene Gesserit, if that makes sense. Although I haven’t figured out in how that possibly becomes more concrete. But I keep going back to a moment when he referred to his mother as his enemy. I assume this battle within him will be centered around her or the BG... I feel like he’s a bit anti-hero but maybe that’s way off. 

3) I’ve also been compiling a list of other classics on my TBR list: 
•Left hand of darkness 
•LOTR 
What others should I include?? I’ve seen mega threads for others sci-fi sub genres like westerns etc but not one for classics unless I missed it! 

Thanks everyone! Happy reading. ","I’m 36 &amp; just finished Dune. It completely blew my mind. Hi everyone!! I literally just put the book down...

"Apolitical, libertarian, or conservative Sci-Fi","Lately, almost every sci-fi I have been watching has been heavily pushing extreme leftist agenda, be it identity politics with the evil white male patriarchy being destroyed through intersectionalism theme ad nauseum, or gender politics of the masculine Mary Sue that ""don't need no man"", the villain or bumbling idiot white guy and altruistic self-sacrificing black guy that helps the white female and toxic masculinity trope, and so forth.

Fahrenheit 451,"Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there. 

It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.”

Looking for a compilation of short stories in comic form,"In the early 1990s or so, I read a comic adaptation of several science fiction short stories. 

One was about scientists who invent a device allowing them to view events and people from the past. One of the first things they do is observe Newton’s life to see why he went into the occult so heavily.

They don’t find any causes until Newton’s deathbed, where he confesses that he is not afraid of death because for all his life, he has felt the “angels” watching him closely.

Hyperion and The Canterbury Tales,"The first time I read Hyperion I think I was 12, and I've read it half a dozen or so times since. It's one of those great books that fits differently depending on your life experiences.

There's a prologue, and then it launches into each character's story during a pilgramage. There's some overlap in characters (e.g., the Narrator and the Consul).

Do you think actual starships would have day/night cycles (with adjusted lighting)?,"Curious what people believe about this. I'm talking a large starship, let's use something like the Enterprise (pick one). 

Because it's established that the crew runs in shifts like a factory, either 12/12 or 8/8/8 or some sort of configuration of hours. Generally seems to be the focus across various series that the shifts tend to be more or less fully staffed, which makes sense. Space is space, there's no ""night"" in space so why would you reduce a shift to a skeleton crew? Anything could pretty much happen anytime.

So with those assumptions generally made. Do you think actual starships would incorporate a simulated day/night cycle?

Assuming they still use earth days for time,  would they still have ""shipboard"" daytime / nighttime hours, and adjust lights and dimming accordingly, in order to try to keep humans comfortable in a temporal sense, health wise?

Or would everything just be ""brightly lit"" and fully ""on"" at all times, with no concept of an end of day, or a night cycle? Would that mess people up, if they had no concept of day / night? Worse than even actual (navy) ships and submarines, because regardless of shifts there's still a day/night in the outside world with which to mentally measure yourself against. 

Curious to hear opinions. Discuss!

Biff's sports betting in Back to the Future,"Wouldn't his own betting result change sports results and possibly make the almanac ineffective?  


Once a team learns that this expert sports bettor is betting against them, they might perform actions that will result in them doing better. Perhaps they'll just practice longer hours. Maybe the coach will search for new strategies about how to win. Whatever the case, they might do actions that'll change the result.

&amp;#x200B;

To make things all the worse, once Biff changes one game result he might change sports history.  For example, if the Saints learn he's betting for the Eagles in the 2 team's 1968 matchup, the Saints improve their performance and win the game. As a result, the Eagles finish 1-13 and get the first pick in the 1969 NFL draft (ahead of the 1-12-1 Bills) and draft OJ  Simpson. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not even getting into more complicated and wacky scenarios like Biff accidentally drops his betting ticket, before Biff can pick the ticket up somebody trips on the ticket and seriously injures themselves, the ambulance that's coming to pick up the injured person gets in an accident that clogs traffic from Hill Valley to LA, the Los Angeles Dodgers are about to be late to their game because of the traffic jam, so their team bus driver takes some risky moves and ends up killing the whole team. Which means the Dodgers have to cancel the rest of their season and start over with a whole new roster the next year.","Biff's sports betting in Back to the Future Wouldn't his own betting result change sports results and possibly make the almanac ineffective?

What really bothers me about The Orville,"I tuned into the first season of The Orville, and I enjoyed it. Funny storylines, likeable characters, engaging action sequences and it felt more like an homage than a send up to the Star Trek that I love. However, in the first season and especially in the first episode of the second season (haven't made it past that first episode) I was blown away by how much alcohol is used as a solution to problems. It's unreal. Seth MacFarlane vehicles usually have characters who drink, and I don't usually have any problem with it, but the sheer volume of references to alcohol as an answer to problems in the first ten minutes of Season 2, Episode 1 astonished me. For reference, I work in the fine wine and spirits field, and I appreciate free advertising as much as the next guy, but Seth's alcohol referencing in this show stinks of propaganda, lazy writing and a problem with Seth MacFarlane's writing. Anyone else see this? Am I over-reacting? I'd appreciate your thoughts.","What really bothers me about The Orville I tuned into the first season of The Orville, and I enjoyed it.

The goal is to keep this subreddit as spam free as possible and we all know how easy it is to game the system. To that end, we've restricted self-promotion to Saturdays. No other sub allows *any* self-promotion unless that's its purpose, but we thought it would be a good, fun thing for our subscribers.

Clear enough? If you're promoting your own original content, *even if it's in response to someone's question*, then do it via PM.

The alternative is people finding ways around the letter of the rule rather than working for the intent.

Thanks, and GL","[Announcement] -- Saturdays are now officially self-promo Saturdays. It has worked out pretty well, so if you have something you want to share, do it on Saturday. We want fresh, new content, original content by the creators.

I just watched Oblivion yet again. I love this movie.," 

I love this movie flaws and all, or what I think are flaws but maybe they're not flaws, who knows?

&amp;#x200B;

For  one why run right to Earth when the Tet with its vast technology  could  stripmine all the gas giants in our solar system for less cost and  not  have to defend itself or attack anyone? Why jump right to Earth?

&amp;#x200B;

Also  who built the fancy towers that defy gravity and the aircraft all  the  clones fly? If the Tet could do that it can bloody well look after   itself and had zero need for the elaborate plan which was bound to fail.    For one it cloned the Jack's so well that their original memories   began to surface with little effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Just  it's a fun movie, I love it but it has things that jump right out at  you that even on multiple viewings I notice but I let it slide because  it's a fun movie.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway can we talk about it?

Anyone else think Stargate Universe was the best Stargate series?,"I enjoyed SG-1 although it got weaker in the Ori seasons but thought SGA was an average rehash overall without much creativity.

SGU was refreshing after 15 seasons of lighthearted episodic stories. I appreciated the more flawed human characters, serious tone and focus on survival and mystery instead of a clear cartoony evil bad guy and repetitive exploration of samey looking planets.

It got too much hate from fans of the franchise who just wanted more of the same instead of being open to something new so sadly it failed and was cancelled. Huge shame tbh","Anyone else think Stargate Universe was the best Stargate series?

Sources or pathology of satisfaction for Artificial Intelligence...?,"I saw some Matrix stuff in the press lately and on the sub and it got me thinking. When Smith looks to be defeating Neo, or when he's exacting torture on Morpheus, he seems to be enjoying it and taking satisfaction in his skill and their suffering. Smith isn't the only AI or program represented in Sci Fi as having these sorts of emotions, but unlike Replicants in BR or the like, he doesn't seem to have emotions informed by implanted memories. 

How would we explain his ability to become frustrated? I am using Smith as an example but am interested in any character that is both non human, not conditioned by memories, and displaying things like sadism in any other sci fi universe. How might this be explained?","Sources or pathology of satisfaction for Artificial Intelligence...? I saw some Matrix stuff in the press lately and on the sub and it got me thinking.

Looking for partners to start an online science fiction magazine!,"Haven't had much luck in other subs, maybe here there's interest! 

So here's the deal: I'd like to start a bi-monthy (or monthly) ""hard"" science fiction online magazine. By hard I mean the science fiction needs to be plausible in our universe, and not fantasy. I can create and manage the website where the magazine would be published, and so your tasks would involve minor editing of the stories, and reading all of the submissions we get to decide which of them we would publish. This is not time-demanding at all, especially if the magazine is bi-monthly.

Perhaps the important part for most people reading this would be that partners would have to help me pay (equally among all) the writers for their quality stories. I explain the amounts below.

So, in short, I'm looking for partners who:

- Are passionate about science fiction (plausible/hard science fiction, in particular), and would want to help create an online magazine.
- Are willing to read story submissions, decide on their favorite stories, and can help pay authors (dividing equally among all partners, currently just myself). 
- Payment of authors is debatable, my idea was something like 4 cents per word, with the average story being ~5000 words long, and each issue of the magazine having 3 stories to begin with.
 
If there's any questions feel free to ask! I hope there's interest (:","Looking for partners to start an online science fiction magazine! Haven't had much luck in other subs, maybe here there's interest!

Presenting my Scifi Fantasy project - Everdream: Stars Hold No Boundaries.,"Hello, I'd like to show y'all my sci-fi/fantasy webcomic that I've been working on since february of 2018. It's a passion project about the story of a girl in a very, very distant future. Her name is Cozmata and she lives with her adoptive mom and her aunt in a planet called Juuna. It is a lighthearted story about Cozmata getting involved on things much bigger than her, and having to rely on her family and those close to her to get past it. It is inspired by famous titles of sci-fi, fantasy and even slice of life like Star Wars, Destiny, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls and Hilda.

There is tonnes of separate lore that I've created for the universe, including the Federo-Etherian War, the Cloud Theocracy and many other very interesting concepts I intend on implementing one way or another in future chapters.

Anyway, enough bragging! Here's the link if any of you want to check it out:

"[Self-Promo Saturday] The Lostkind, now available to read before you buy!","Submitted for your approval, a speculative fiction novel.

[The Lostkind](https://matt-stephens.blogspot.com/p/the-lostkind.html), by Matt Stephens

My first original novel; this one is always going to have a special place in my heart. Up until this point I had only written fanfics. (Well received, and over a million words combined.)

This novel was hard to define, as it reads like a fantasy, but there's no supernatural element. I would define it as an Urban Fantasy with a Steampunk-vibe instead of a Mystical one.

For me, the best fiction has always been one where you can turn off the movie, or put down the book and say: ""Now, can I prove it isn't a true story?""

In an effort to drive up interest/sales; I have also put the complete book up on my blog, [chapter by chapter](https://matt-stephens.blogspot.com/p/the-lostkind-table-of-contents-page.html). Try before you buy.

And if you do happen to enjoy it, but don't want to buy, can I ask that you take the time to spread the word, instead? Tell a friend, request a copy for your local library, or post a review on Amazon. All these options are free; and would be greatly appreciated.","[Self-Promo Saturday] The Lostkind, now available to read before you buy! Submitted for your approval, a speculative fiction novel.

Who is the Mystery Girl?

Bernard Abbey’s life was routine, stagnant, and lonely. That all changed the day she entered his life. To save him from being killed, a mysterious young woman transports Bernard to another point in time. As he comes to grips with what has happened, Bernard realizes his new friend is unable to speak. She cannot tell him who she is, where she came from, or how she can travel through time. Even worse, she’s unable to tell him what is chasing her.

As she takes him back and forth in time, they cross paths with strangers who claim to know his new friend, each with a different story of her origin. The only thing he knows for certain is that the fate of humanity’s idyllic future is somehow connected with his new companion.

"Trilogy where everyone had a virtual AI personal assistant Avatar, from the mid-2000s...?","Hi everyone!

I read through the rules and, unless I missed something, I hope this post doesn't go against them... if it does, or if there's a better place to ask, do let me know!

In the mid-2000s I remember reading a book where everyone had virtual AI personal assistants. These assistants had Avatars, and communicated with one another.
Each of these assistants might have had a name - the name of one of them is right under my tongue, but I really can't recall it... Might have been related to greek mythology, or something like that? I really don't know.

As far as I remember it was a book trilogy, and at that time the third book had not been published yet - or, at least, it hadn't been translated into my language yet. So that's why I believe it was published somewhere in the mid-2000s.

I don't remember anything of the plot, or names, or locations. I vaguely remember that things started going wrong in this virtual world... The vague image of ""boxes with viruses"" come to mind, but it might be gibberish :)

I tried a lot of Google searches, but came up empty - as far as I remember, this was never hugely popular. At least I don't remember seeing it discussed anywhere, and nothing came up on Google.

I know it's a super long shot, but maybe someone knows what I'm talking about?

I'd love to remember what this trilogy was, and pick it back up again!

Either way, thank you all in advance, and have an awesome day!","Trilogy where everyone had a virtual AI personal assistant Avatar, from the mid-2000s...? Hi everyone!

Crescendians

======

Biology

=======

A Race of Humanoids that closely resembles Humanity but with the Destructive Ability to manipulate and control Gravity and Magnetic Powers

&amp;#x200B;

They have 2 hands and 2 legs and they are nearly indistinguishable due to appearance but organ wise, they are different from humans

&amp;#x200B;

Crescendians typically conceal and suppress their powers and only use it when necessary

&amp;#x200B;

Only a Crescendian is ever seen and is part of UFS Starfleet as a Science Officer

&amp;#x200B;

========

Origins

========

The Crescendians were once a Vast Powerful Empire that exists in the Gamma Quadrant until the Rise of the Grolls, once a biological speices that became a race of Asimilating Robots, it started small but became a uncontrollable threat, many worlds devoured by Groll Harversters and entire population hubs assimilated, the Military waged a bloody war againts the Groll but they lost the war, in the final days of the War, the Groll encroaches Cresta the original Crescendian Homeworld, 50 Worldships guarded by 30 Imperius Class Battleships fled to deep space while the remnants of the military fought to the bitter end, ground combat wise the Crescendians fare better due to thier Manipulation of gravity and Magnetic Powers, 1 Crescendian is equivalent to 10 Groll Drones, but in space the advantage goes to the Grolls, Massive Groll War Cubes that are immune to any form of weapons that the Crescendians can throw at them, resulting in Severe losses. By the time they created the necessary countermeasures, it was too late as the Groll was practically at their door step, the only ship with the countermeasures will go on to inspire the Crescendians to build the Legion Class Strikeships.

&amp;#x200B;

As the small fleet escaped to deep space, Cresta has fallen, the Empire was no more.

&amp;#x200B;

Cast away from the Gamma Quadrant, the Crescendians Travelled among the Stars searching for a new home (the Milky Way in my version is far larger) as centuries passed Worldships by worldships were destroyed or disbanded, one by one, the Battleship Escorts fell into disrepair and constant pirate attacks until the fleet discovered a Wormhole that will collapse but it will transport them to the Beta Quadrant, as centuries passed while they travel towards the Wormhole, the surviving Worldships combine themselves into one massive Worldship for a better chance of survival, within that long timeframe, the ship lost access to it's computer drive when a Power surge destroyed it, erasing Centuries Worth of information including thier History, despite the Severe Lost, the surviving Crescendians passed on their knowledge of Technology to future generations so they can use it once they found a home, but the History of the Crescendians were but completely forgotten

&amp;#x200B;

After so many Generations passed, by the time they cross the Wormhole, it transported them to the Beta Quadrant and the Wormhole collapsed, they striked the lottery, they were in a area of space, so full of resources they decided to settle down and the entire Species begin building a massive construct by tearing down the Combined Worldship, creating a massive Singularity Neutron Reactor using the Reactors from the many Worldships, they continued building in a fast pace and within a Year they constructed ""Crest"" thier new Homeworld, finally settling down, the Crescendians begin laying claim to surrounding Stars and eventually they formed the now modern Crescsius Empire

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughout the Centuries, the Crescsius Empire contacted many speices but kept a closed Borders stance, they were held in High Regards by the Altairian

&amp;#x200B;

In the final days of the Dominion War, the Allied Fleet was above the Clardassian Homeworld (my version of Cardassians), facing a massive fleet of Jana'dar and Windaxian ships, the Crescsius Empire finally joins the war and assisted the allies in winning the final battle, ending the Dominion War

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

====================

Military Forces and Defense

====================

The Standing Military Force of the Crescsius Empire is the War Fleet consisting of 15 000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

Defending the Empire is the Guardian Fleet consisting of 24 000 Strikeships, the same kind of ship used by the War Fleet

&amp;#x200B;

And defending the Empire's Home System and Capital is the Praetorian Fleet consisting of 8000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

The Military only uses one type of ship which is the Legion Class Strikeship which is based from the designs of the Imperius Class Battleships, the ancient ships that escorted the many Crescendian Worldships as they were finding a new home, unlike other Galactic Powers like the Kahlesia Empire (my version of the Klingons) or the UFS (my version of the Federation) which possesses mulitple ship classes, the Legion Class has been used by the Empire for Centuries and has remained as thier main Workhorse, winning Multiple wars, they are very heavily Shielded and Armored and Armed and is about the length of a Galaxy Class and Firepower that rivals both the Prometheus Class or Defiant Class and the Triumph Card of the Legion Class is their Shields and weapons are undetectable and leaves behind no energy traces and is also unadaptable by Groll Technology (my version of the Borg)

&amp;#x200B;

Strikeship Specs

Crew = 4600

Propulsion = 4 Gravity Impulse Drives, 2 Class 9 warp cores

Weapons = 8 Dimensional Wave Strips, 4 Frontal Torpedo and 2 back Torpedo

Defense = Double Layer Unimatrix Shield Grid, 20 Meter Heavy Composite Allow Composition Armor

Weakness = very slow combat speed and turning rate

&amp;#x200B;

============

Technology

============

The Crescendians posses Advanced Technologies that rivals the UFS or the Kahlesia or the Dominion, they posses Advanced Replicator Facilities that are able to recreate none Crescendian Technology with ease, and they were able to Replicate a Hermes Class Explorer (JJprise USS Kelvin) molecules to molecules, wires by wires, Everything, all within just a Hour

&amp;#x200B;

The most greatest Technological Advancements they achieved is Mega Colossal Stellar Engineering, they were able to build Crest, the Capital World, within JUST a Year and improved thier Technology and go on to build multiple Artificial Worlds WITHIN MONTHS across the Crescsius Empire  while it took a massive Combined Collaboration of the UFS and the Kahlesia Empire and 4 other Major Galactic Powers, 50 YEARS to build Starbase Unity (my version of Starbase Yorktown). Not even the Groll or Dominion can do such advanced feats

&amp;#x200B;

======================

Crescsius Empire Capital

====================

""Crest""

The Crescendian Capital, a massive Artificial Construct that is far bigger (larger then Starbase Yorktown, ST Beyond) then Earth and it's the Center of Crescendian Power and Sovereignty

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Population Size

There's an Estimated 360,000,000,000 Souls living in Crest, which is 40 Percent of the Entire Crescendian Species

&amp;#x200B;

The population is more the UFS's Starbase Unity

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Infarstructure

the Center of the Construct is a Singularity Neutron Power Core that powers the entire Homeworld, the Construct contains a Artificial Atmosphere Regulated by 6 Atmospheric Towers and Lush Gardens and Fields across the surface and many Business and Cooperate Cities and a Exposed Naval Pier covered only by a Colossal Blast Door which houses 8000 ships, the Praetorian Fleet protecting Crest, while beneath the Surface houses the Vast Population Hubs and Recreation Centers and deeper nearer the Core houses the vast Replicator Factories and Assembly Plants and Laboratories and also contains a Massive Naval Pier that houses 15 000 ships, the Crescendian War Fleet and Vast Barracks and Training Centers for Soldiers and at the very center is the Power Core

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Planetary Defenses

Guarding Crest is a Network of Heavily Armed Satellites that protect Crest, followed by a Outer Planetary Shield that covers the entire Capital World and is controlled by 6 Orbital Shield Generators with only a single entrance guarded by a Heavily Armed Fortress that acts as Custom Control for ships in and out of the Capital while acting as a Civilian Shipyard and Trading Center and contains mulitple Shopping Centers and Hotels

&amp;#x200B;

Within Crest itself the Artificial World is also protected by a Planetary Sheild that is cushioned right above the Magnetic Sphere that keeps the Atmosphere of Crest breathable, space between the Shield and the Outer Planetary Shield is quite far, which is far enough that many Youngsters like to fly to that area and recreate famous dogfights, a constant nuisance for the Police, besides the Shields, the entire Surface contains a massive Network of Guns that can fire Repulsor Beams to ward away ships or Gravitational Beams to Vaporise entire Fleets, one gun is enough to destroy a Fully Shielded Fully Tactical Modified Galaxy Class in one Shot at low power and the Artificial World posses a Total of 100 000 spread across the Surface

&amp;#x200B;

A massive fleet of 8000 Warships defends the Artificial World and the Crescia System from Intruders or Invaders

&amp;#x200B;

Combining all of it's Defenses makes Crest arguably the most Heavily Fortified and Heavily Defended and Heavily Populated World in all of the Milky Way

&amp;#x200B;

The Defense Satellites are nested in-between the Outer Planetary Shield and Inner Planetary Shield

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Crest is very Similar to Coruscant from Star Wars the only difference is Coruscant is originally a Planet but Crest is entirely Artificial, there's little to no Green Grass spots in Coruscant but there's large Continent sized Grass Lands and Forests on Crest

&amp;#x200B;

Another difference is Coruscant is a City Planet, completely covered by cities and no empty lands, while Crest is only 40% covered by Cities

&amp;#x200B;

The only Artificial Object of similar strength is Starbase Unity which is also guarded by a Network of Satellites and Surface Guns

&amp;#x200B;","An alien Species I made myself (this is part of a Star Trek Fan Story made by me)
Crescendians

======

Biology

=======

A Race of Humanoids that closely resembles Humanity but with the Destructive Ability to manipulate and control Gravity and Magnetic Powers

&amp;#x200B;

They have 2 hands and 2 legs and they are nearly indistinguishable due to appearance but organ wise, they are different from humans

&amp;#x200B;

Crescendians typically conceal and suppress their powers and only use it when necessary

&amp;#x200B;

Only a Crescendian is ever seen and is part of UFS Starfleet as a Science Officer

&amp;#x200B;

========

Origins

========

The Crescendians were once a Vast Powerful Empire that exists in the Gamma Quadrant until the Rise of the Grolls, once a biological speices that became a race of Asimilating Robots, it started small but became a uncontrollable threat, many worlds devoured by Groll Harversters and entire population hubs assimilated, the Military waged a bloody war againts the Groll but they lost the war, in the final days of the War, the Groll encroaches Cresta the original Crescendian Homeworld, 50 Worldships guarded by 30 Imperius Class Battleships fled to deep space while the remnants of the military fought to the bitter end, ground combat wise the Crescendians fare better due to thier Manipulation of gravity and Magnetic Powers, 1 Crescendian is equivalent to 10 Groll Drones, but in space the advantage goes to the Grolls, Massive Groll War Cubes that are immune to any form of weapons that the Crescendians can throw at them, resulting in Severe losses. By the time they created the necessary countermeasures, it was too late as the Groll was practically at their door step, the only ship with the countermeasures will go on to inspire the Crescendians to build the Legion Class Strikeships.

&amp;#x200B;

As the small fleet escaped to deep space, Cresta has fallen, the Empire was no more.

&amp;#x200B;

Cast away from the Gamma Quadrant, the Crescendians Travelled among the Stars searching for a new home (the Milky Way in my version is far larger) as centuries passed Worldships by worldships were destroyed or disbanded, one by one, the Battleship Escorts fell into disrepair and constant pirate attacks until the fleet discovered a Wormhole that will collapse but it will transport them to the Beta Quadrant, as centuries passed while they travel towards the Wormhole, the surviving Worldships combine themselves into one massive Worldship for a better chance of survival, within that long timeframe, the ship lost access to it's computer drive when a Power surge destroyed it, erasing Centuries Worth of information including thier History, despite the Severe Lost, the surviving Crescendians passed on their knowledge of Technology to future generations so they can use it once they found a home, but the History of the Crescendians were but completely forgotten

&amp;#x200B;

After so many Generations passed, by the time they cross the Wormhole, it transported them to the Beta Quadrant and the Wormhole collapsed, they striked the lottery, they were in a area of space, so full of resources they decided to settle down and the entire Species begin building a massive construct by tearing down the Combined Worldship, creating a massive Singularity Neutron Reactor using the Reactors from the many Worldships, they continued building in a fast pace and within a Year they constructed ""Crest"" thier new Homeworld, finally settling down, the Crescendians begin laying claim to surrounding Stars and eventually they formed the now modern Crescsius Empire

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughout the Centuries, the Crescsius Empire contacted many speices but kept a closed Borders stance, they were held in High Regards by the Altairian

&amp;#x200B;

In the final days of the Dominion War, the Allied Fleet was above the Clardassian Homeworld (my version of Cardassians), facing a massive fleet of Jana'dar and Windaxian ships, the Crescsius Empire finally joins the war and assisted the allies in winning the final battle, ending the Dominion War

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

====================

Military Forces and Defense

====================

The Standing Military Force of the Crescsius Empire is the War Fleet consisting of 15 000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

Defending the Empire is the Guardian Fleet consisting of 24 000 Strikeships, the same kind of ship used by the War Fleet

&amp;#x200B;

And defending the Empire's Home System and Capital is the Praetorian Fleet consisting of 8000 Strikeships

&amp;#x200B;

The Military only uses one type of ship which is the Legion Class Strikeship which is based from the designs of the Imperius Class Battleships, the ancient ships that escorted the many Crescendian Worldships as they were finding a new home, unlike other Galactic Powers like the Kahlesia Empire (my version of the Klingons) or the UFS (my version of the Federation) which possesses mulitple ship classes, the Legion Class has been used by the Empire for Centuries and has remained as thier main Workhorse, winning Multiple wars, they are very heavily Shielded and Armored and Armed and is about the length of a Galaxy Class and Firepower that rivals both the Prometheus Class or Defiant Class and the Triumph Card of the Legion Class is their Shields and weapons are undetectable and leaves behind no energy traces and is also unadaptable by Groll Technology (my version of the Borg)

&amp;#x200B;

Strikeship Specs

Crew = 4600

Propulsion = 4 Gravity Impulse Drives, 2 Class 9 warp cores

Weapons = 8 Dimensional Wave Strips, 4 Frontal Torpedo and 2 back Torpedo

Defense = Double Layer Unimatrix Shield Grid, 20 Meter Heavy Composite Allow Composition Armor

Weakness = very slow combat speed and turning rate

&amp;#x200B;

============

Technology

============

The Crescendians posses Advanced Technologies that rivals the UFS or the Kahlesia or the Dominion, they posses Advanced Replicator Facilities that are able to recreate none Crescendian Technology with ease, and they were able to Replicate a Hermes Class Explorer (JJprise USS Kelvin) molecules to molecules, wires by wires, Everything, all within just a Hour

&amp;#x200B;

The most greatest Technological Advancements they achieved is Mega Colossal Stellar Engineering, they were able to build Crest, the Capital World, within JUST a Year and improved thier Technology and go on to build multiple Artificial Worlds WITHIN MONTHS across the Crescsius Empire  while it took a massive Combined Collaboration of the UFS and the Kahlesia Empire and 4 other Major Galactic Powers, 50 YEARS to build Starbase Unity (my version of Starbase Yorktown). Not even the Groll or Dominion can do such advanced feats

&amp;#x200B;

======================

Crescsius Empire Capital

====================

""Crest""

The Crescendian Capital, a massive Artificial Construct that is far bigger (larger then Starbase Yorktown, ST Beyond) then Earth and it's the Center of Crescendian Power and Sovereignty

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Population Size

There's an Estimated 360,000,000,000 Souls living in Crest, which is 40 Percent of the Entire Crescendian Species

&amp;#x200B;

The population is more the UFS's Starbase Unity

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Infarstructure

the Center of the Construct is a Singularity Neutron Power Core that powers the entire Homeworld, the Construct contains a Artificial Atmosphere Regulated by 6 Atmospheric Towers and Lush Gardens and Fields across the surface and many Business and Cooperate Cities and a Exposed Naval Pier covered only by a Colossal Blast Door which houses 8000 ships, the Praetorian Fleet protecting Crest, while beneath the Surface houses the Vast Population Hubs and Recreation Centers and deeper nearer the Core houses the vast Replicator Factories and Assembly Plants and Laboratories and also contains a Massive Naval Pier that houses 15 000 ships, the Crescendian War Fleet and Vast Barracks and Training Centers for Soldiers and at the very center is the Power Core

&amp;#x200B;

\--- Planetary Defenses

Guarding Crest is a Network of Heavily Armed Satellites that protect Crest, followed by a Outer Planetary Shield that covers the entire Capital World and is controlled by 6 Orbital Shield Generators with only a single entrance guarded by a Heavily Armed Fortress that acts as Custom Control for ships in and out of the Capital while acting as a Civilian Shipyard and Trading Center and contains mulitple Shopping Centers and Hotels

&amp;#x200B;

Within Crest itself the Artificial World is also protected by a Planetary Sheild that is cushioned right above the Magnetic Sphere that keeps the Atmosphere of Crest breathable, space between the Shield and the Outer Planetary Shield is quite far, which is far enough that many Youngsters like to fly to that area and recreate famous dogfights, a constant nuisance for the Police, besides the Shields, the entire Surface contains a massive Network of Guns that can fire Repulsor Beams to ward away ships or Gravitational Beams to Vaporise entire Fleets, one gun is enough to destroy a Fully Shielded Fully Tactical Modified Galaxy Class in one Shot at low power and the Artificial World posses a Total of 100 000 spread across the Surface

&amp;#x200B;

A massive fleet of 8000 Warships defends the Artificial World and the Crescia System from Intruders or Invaders

&amp;#x200B;

Combining all of it's Defenses makes Crest arguably the most Heavily Fortified and Heavily Defended and Heavily Populated World in all of the Milky Way

&amp;#x200B;

The Defense Satellites are nested in-between the Outer Planetary Shield and Inner Planetary Shield

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Crest is very Similar to Coruscant from Star Wars the only difference is Coruscant is originally a Planet but Crest is entirely Artificial, there's little to no Green Grass spots in Coruscant but there's large Continent sized Grass Lands and Forests on Crest

&amp;#x200B;

Which TV shows about Artificial Intelligence have had the biggest influence on you?,"(I’m a new/inexperienced redditor, apologies if this is inappropriate/incorrect)
I’m a screenwriter/director, and I I tend to write stories involving AI. I was recently re-watching some of my favorite television shows about artificial intelligence, and I was surprised by how many ideas and concepts I’d subconsciously absorbed as part of my own AI mythology. I’d love to hear more about which shows people love and why. Here are mine:

1. Westworld - This is the most thoughtful series out right now addressing AI ethics and philosophy, and represents Crichton’s ideology that life always finds a way with Nolan’s ongoing interest in philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and memory.  
2. Person of Interest - The philosophical arguments about the AI Alignment problem are delicious, the ideas around the weaponization of AI are thoughtful, and the overall theme of existential risk from artificial general intelligence but for a general audience (On CBS!) was just amazing.
3. Caprica - I’m just finishing up this rewatch now, and loving the discussions about Philosophy of mind, and the difference between a human mind, an Avatar, and a digital self. 
4. Battlestar Galactica - And of course in BSG we see the ultimate result of the decisions made in Caprica, and what the outcome was for humans. 
5. Dollhouse - While this show doesn’t explicitly discuss AI, that’s essential what is happening - and the idea of people being loaded with new skills and personalities is matrix-like as well as something that we see in an explicitly AI context in Westworld
6. Jem and the Holograms - This was my earliest memory of an impactful and relatable AI in the form of Synergy, and she was from an era of kind and empathetic AIs and is more in the form of Nick Bostrom’s “Oracle” friendly AI, as she rarely took action, and manifested and altered reality in the form of local holograms projected from a pair of earrings. 
7. Max Headroom - More of the Dollhouse/Caprica AI ideas of downloading a person’s neurological data to re-create their personality as an AI. 
8. Altered Carbon - The hotel AI here is a wonderful representation of a thoughtful building in a pantheon of AIs that have little more than disdain for the humans that they now exploit. 
9. Knight Rider - A limited friendly AI, much like Synergy, but one that had a strong impact on me as a kid and created positive feelings for artificial life forms. 

I’m aware of the show Humans, but it didn’t capture my interest yet. Are there any other TV shows specifically that have AI as a major character or theme?  I know that Red Dwarf and Star Trek have AIs, but I feel that AI wasn’t a primary character or theme like it is in the above shows. 

I’d love your thoughts and recommendations. ","Which TV shows about Artificial Intelligence have had the biggest influence on you? (I’m a new/inexperienced redditor, apologies if this is inappropriate/incorrect)

Heinlein's Tunnel in the Sky (spoilers),"A group of high school students are sent to a wild planet for an ""Advanced Survival Class"" where they're supposed to survive for two weeks. They are told several times to beware of the ""stobor"". This word is supposed to be a stand-in for any dangerous creature, but in my high school brain, I spotted ""robots"" spelled backwards. For 90% of the story I mistakenly believed that the jump gate wasn't lost, but the kids were in an extended simulation where they were being observed by robots. Forty years later it still makes me chuckle. Great book, you should read it. I haven't had the patience to reread any of Heinlein's longer works, but the juveniles are great.

Looking for a story about massively increased intelligence and murder,"Inspired by this sub's ability to get [u/jcsensational](https://www.reddit.com/user/jcsensational) the story he was looking for, I have to give a try for one that has been driving me crazy for years.  I THINK I read it in Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine or Analogue, but it could have been from an anthology.

&amp;#x200B;

The story is about lab subjects given massively increased intelligence ala Flowers for Algernon.  The main character escapes the lab.  A fractured bit of scene I recall is that he spoofs a login or lock screen by building up a counterfeit screen from assembly language, gains someone's credentials and effects his escape.  He goes on to acquire a bunch of wealth on the outside.  Another slice of remembered scene is him installing positive feedback loops within the CEOs of companies he invests in just by having casual conversation with them.  He eventually notices perturbances in the stock market that could only be created by someone with intelligence equal to his own, with this other party using the market as a whole to send a message to him.  Someone else has escaped the lab.

&amp;#x200B;

The two titans meet, and have a deeply productive conversation as one has used his abilities to study the human condition, while the other has focused on study of the external world.  As I recall, they then go about trying to murder one another, with one eventually winning by imprinting a pattern on a tee shirt that, upon seeing it, leads the other into an inescapable mental loop (shades of Infinite Jest or Snow Crash, but I am pretty sure this story precedes both).  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I have been trying to hunt down this story for years, but my Googlefu has always proven inadequate.  Let's see if crowd-sourcing works!  This ringing any bells?  It obviously made quite an impression as the perfect adolescent power fantasy for me.  I would love to know who wrote it to explore more of their work.

"In many science fiction stories, the existence of God is denied. Could we call science fiction as an atheist literary genre?","In science fiction literature, many stories take place either on a fictional rendition of Earth or involve protagonists who either lived on Earth at some point or who have ancestors who lived on Earth. In our real world, the entire global population is slowly trending toward atheism or at least nonreligious affiliation, except perhaps for Islam, which is actually expanding. Nonetheless, if the trend toward atheism and other nonreligious affiliation persists, then even Islam’s growth can be expected to halt and recede.

Since most science fiction stories take place in a universe where some version of real-world Earth existed, we can expect the dismissal of God (or any god for that matter) to be widespread within those stories, especially if the story in question is so far in the future that something like interstellar travel is routine (still impossible with our current technology and no signs of becoming possible in any foreseeable future).

Moreover, even though the stories that authors tell are clearly fictional, the god claim is apparently way too fictional even for them. That is fair: it is clearly evidence that God does not exist in our real world and therefore would not exist in any imagination of a future based on our real world.","In many science fiction stories, the existence of God is denied.

Seeking 1980's Sci-Fi short story collection with entry about a praying mantis from her perspective,"I read this story back in the mid-90's, so this is all from 20+ year old memories.

The sci-fi collection book had a red cover with a large breasted alien/robot. Or maybe the alien was red but the cover was not.

The praying mantis story was called something like ""A Day in the Life of Tsang Jueng"" and was from the perspective of the praying mantis. She hunted and interacted with her environment. At one point she meets a spider and the differing hunting methods, net vs ambush, is discussed. She kills and eats a caterpillar.

Help choosing next book,"Hi, this is my first post in this sub.
I just finished a book I was reading and I want to read some scifi novel next (preferably spanning several books).

changing the past for a better future?,"I see a lot of scifi with backwards time travel play with the idea of changing history. Mostly exploring how to avoid paradoxes, or to ensure that everything remain exactly the same, or sometimes with characters individually choosing to live in the past for some personal preference with the understanding that nothing will really change because of that.

But I am looking for a different angle. Does anyone know of any work that explores the idea that changing the status quo might actually be beneficial in both the past and with future developments? Like a good ""let's kill hitler"" story where the lesson isn't ""well all those people needed to die otherwise our dystopian state would end up even worse than it already is!"". But more an exploration of a timeline where leftists won the culture war post world war 1 in germany. Or to prevent the genocide of native americans, and what it might be like if colonists lived in peace and adopted non hierarchal values instead of trying to own and control the natives. Or an exploration of what it would be like if aristocratic values died  before capitalism could be established as a valid school of thought, and how that would result in expanding democracy and social consciousness in general. 

It all feels very ""The status quo is what we know, it's safe. Anything different than we have now must fundamentally be worse. The system sucks, but it could be worse, so I guess it's fine."" which I find a bit unfulfilling and non challenging of conservative ideology, as well as lacking in historical context. Which I find odd, since the scifi genre is typically full of leftist influence, especially when there's space exploration or colonization involved. Not to mention all about exploring hypotheticals and sometimes even alternative universes.

But I also feel like I must have missed something because it makes no sense for those themes to have never been explored before in relation to traveling back in time.","changing the past for a better future?

"I arranged Song Of Durin (Lord Of The Rings) for 13 Cellos, here is the result ! (100+ hours of work)","Video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo)

&amp;#x200B;

I am in love with Tolkien World, Lord of the Rings books, films, &amp; soundtrack.

Song Of Durin was composed by Clamavi de Profundis, an awesome singer band doing Cover &amp; Original composition around Tolkien Universe. I am a huge fan of the original music, so I decided to make the Cello Cover for 13 Cellos.

This music fits perfectly with the deep warm &amp; mysterious sound of the Cello. There are 7 differents parts, all played twice except the Melody (in the big central screen).

2 Cellos are doing the lower bass (on the down side corner), holding a single deep note : Bb on the C string (I use a scordatura = detune the cello to gain access to lower note than on a normal cello)

2 Cellos are doing the upper bass (on the left side)

2 Cellos are doing the tenor (on the right side)

4 Cellos are doing the alto (on the top side, split into 2)

And finally, 2 cellos are doing drums, I had to remix &amp; change a lot the sound to make the sound better :)

A huge thanks to Clamavi De Profundis for creating this awesome music &amp; for sharing for free the sheet music (available in description)

Thanks everyone, hope you enjoyed this one !﻿","I arranged Song Of Durin (Lord Of The Rings) for 13 Cellos, here is the result ! (100+ hours of work) Video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo)

Struggled through 'Consider Phlebas'. Loving 'Excession'. Will I like……?,"My friend lent me a pile of books from the Culture series, minus ‘The Player of Games’ and ‘Use of Weapons’. I started with 'Consider Phlebas', expecting to love it having read a number of Bank’s fiction works and having enjoyed those (especially 'The Wasp Factory').  

Sadly I found CP a chore. It just seemed to drag for me and was too long-winded. It redeemed itself somewhat by the time it got to chapter 9, Schar’s World. I enjoyed the last third of the book more than the previous two thirds.  

Even so, at that point I was still considering whether to read another. However, I am glad I did. I have started on 'Excession' and I am loving it. Lots of interesting ideas; more insight into the Culture; the different personalities of the AI ships; more intrigue and suspense.  

Part of the problem with CP, for me, is that you very quickly discover what the story is about. Let’s all go to Schar’s World. Excession has more mystery and suspense.  

Given that I am loving 'Excession' do you think that I would like **‘The Player of Games’** and **‘Use of Weapons’**, as I am considering buying them? Thanks.","Struggled through 'Consider Phlebas'.

Opinions on Cory Doctrow?,"My science fiction reading for a while has veered towards the more earth bound than space bound.  Even as a kid I was never a huge 'space sci fi' reader.  Large battles never really appealed to me, there are some exceptions, I read what I consider the definitive Star Wars 7/8/9 trilogy by Timothy Zahn.  I get that it's not the 'canon' trilogy but after a double feature of The Last Jedi and Solo when I was laid up in bed recently, I am comfortable saying that no matter how good number 9 is - the Zahn trilogy is still better at least to me.

As a kid I was more a fantasy reader I think, I started getting into sci fi I think in grad school (94-97) with Neuromancer, than Snow Crash, but as I got older I have veered more towards the 'near future stuff'.  I loved the truth machine for instance, and daniel suarez.  I think the Nexus series is amazing and wish Infomacracy wasn't ending.

So, that's my 'point of view', but I also very much like Cory Doctrow's take on things. The brother books, for the wind, makers, those are the ones I've primarily read, but I know he has a broader base of fiction and non fiction and I'm wondering what other people think of him.  Does anyone else like his stuff?

I am working on a project and it involves grouping all live-action sci-fi television shows from 1963 to present day.  Here is my list so far with the groupings I came up with. If you see any shows I missed that match my criteria, could you please comment on the oversight (with info on the show if possible, especially if it isn't a US show). If you disagree with or are curious about my groupings, feel free to inquire.

**Criteria**   

- No animated series
- No sitcoms
- No internet-only series
- Nothing before 1963
- No Marvel/DC originated properties (considering one exception, Legion)
- No mini-series (such as V or Martian Chronicles)
- No fantasy/supernatural dominant series (e.g. Into the Badlands)
- Where a show involves multiple elements, prevailing element, otherwise grouped as ""Other""

","Need help with a project Hi all,   
I am working on a project and it involves grouping all live-action sci-fi television shows from 1963 to present day.  Here is my list so far with the groupings I came up with. If you see any shows I missed that match my criteria, could you please comment on the oversight (with info on the show if possible, especially if it isn't a US show). If you disagree with or are curious about my groupings, feel free to inquire.

**Criteria**   

- No animated series
- No sitcoms
- No internet-only series
- Nothing before 1963
- No Marvel/DC originated properties (considering one exception, Legion)
- No mini-series (such as V or Martian Chronicles)
- No fantasy/supernatural dominant series (e.g. Into the Badlands)
- Where a show involves multiple elements, prevailing element, otherwise grouped as ""Other""

Alastair Reynolds world-(book?)weariness,"So I’ve read most of the fiction in AR’s Revelation Space Universe, I’d finished it all (with the exception of a couple novellas) around Autumn of last year. I’ve recently decided to re-read my way through it. The gothic space opera melded with hard science fiction was an absolute game-changer the first time round.

However, is anyone else struggling to plough through a second read with the knowledge of what happens at the end of his books? Without invoking the spoiler gods, is anyone else having/had this problem? Is there any way around this? 

Also, if anyone dear god has any authors more or less on a similar vein to the darkness/cynicism/hope of AL’s Revelation Space Universe could you plz recommend.

[SPS] Continuum Force | Chapter 6 | Pax Romana Pt III,"**Episode Summary**

In this mid-season finale, key members of the team are disappearing from time and Rome has seized control of the base, the remaining Continuum Force make one last ditch effort to save the timeline and restore things as they should be.

**Show Summary**

An elite force of time travelers discover a terrible truth. The chronicles we’ve known may not be our past, it could have been altered, our memories changed and history itself set on a different path. They investigate these anomalies, traveling to different periods of our ancient past to stop the malevolent enemy trying to write a new chapter in humanity’s story. They are our only defense, heroes of ages ago, today, and the Future. They are…the Continuum Force.

Book description: 

Who is the Mystery Girl?

Bernard Abbey’s life was routine, stagnant, and lonely. That all changed the day she entered his life. To save him from being killed, a mysterious young woman transports Bernard to another point in time. As he comes to grips with what has happened, Bernard realizes his new friend is unable to speak. She cannot tell him who she is, where she came from, or how she can travel through time. Even worse, she’s unable to tell him what is chasing her.

As she takes him back and forth in time, they cross paths with strangers who claim to know his new friend, each with a different story of her origin. The only thing he knows for certain is that the fate of humanity’s idyllic future is somehow connected with his new companion.

“Sanderson blew my temporally-frazzled mind multiple times as the battle ranged from past to present ... and even in-between.” - William F. Aicher - Author of 'The Unfortunate Expiration of Mr. David S. Sparks'

BSG is so disappointing...,"*Spoilers and rant warning*

I'm rewatching B5 right now and being blown away by how well executed everything is plot wise. (Obviously some stuff got rushed at the end of season 4 because the show was about to be canceled only to leave season 5 kind of hollow outside of the centauri plot). 

My point is I remeber being blown away by the BSG miniseries and season 1. The show did a great job of creating a gritty realistic (for a sci fi show in space) scenario in which you truly believed that Galactica had no chance of being successful in saving the remaining human race. Season 2 was pretty good as well, and I was willing to accept the religious prophecies as the seemed to be the only way Galactic had any chance of beating this unstoppable cylon force. 

Then they get stranded on new caprica and it becomes very obvious the show has no clue what it's doing. The ""all of a sudden we don't want to kill you"" Cylon thing completely destroyed the shows amazing tone and from there everything that happened was complete bullshit. The contrast between 33 and the finale where Galactica singlehandedly genocides the Cylons is laughable. 

Sorry for the rant the only reason I brought up B5 is because you can see how JMS had a plan the whole time, where as BSG falls flat on its face once you realize they had no clue how to end it. Little things like the fact the final 5 was not conceived until midway through season 3 really kills the show, and makes the last 2 seasons a real waste.

Beta readers for new possible sci-fi release?,"YEARS ago I wrote something I titled Metro-12, which was about a futuristic society in which supercities had grown up, named Metro-1, 2, 3, etc. and Metro-12 had fallen to a bio disaster that rendered the city cut off from the outside world, surrounded by a poisonous/toxic cloud of biomatter called ""flack,"" and the city itself broken down and filled with mutated humans/zombies and a handful of survivors. Hiro, our MC, has been sent in with AIMEE, the AI of his awesome advanced motorcycle, to investigate and search for someone special.

I abandoned it for some reason, but I found it again and have about 17k words written. It's faced paced, filled with action and I actually really love it and am considering bringing it back for either a series of novels or novellas, but as I have no real experience in the sci-fi realm, I'd love to get some feedback from people. If anyone would be interested in reading for me, either the full 17k or less, let me know here through PM, or e-mail me at stephenroarkbooks@gmail.com and I'll send you over a copy in whatever format suits you.","Beta readers for new possible sci-fi release?

"What are some good ""entry-level"" scifi/scifi for non-scifi-nerds? Specific audiobooks with high quality and relatively easy listening?","Gonna be taking a long roadtrip with my GF in a couple months, and we'll probably grab an audiobook to listen to.

It's for my birthday, so I persuaded her to let me pick the book ;) She even said she might be more open to a scifi book if it's an audiobook, because listening would probably be better than reading.

I'm a longtime fan of the genre and have immersed myself in a lot of hyper-complex worlds (Stephenson novels, currently reading the Night's Dawn trilogy). These are the type of books I want to avoid, as they can even be challenging for me to maintain interest in due to complexity and length.

One of my favorite books ever is Hyperion, which is an *amazing* audiobook as well. Unfortunately I don't think I can consume it again as I've read/listened to it like 4 times, but the prose and storytelling in that book really lends itself to the audiobook format, and I would guess it would be pretty appealing to a non-fan of the genre.

So, what are your recommendations? Something that isn't too heavy on the hard sci-fi/confusing abstractions, but still a great example of the genre. Something that tells a gripping/entertaining story that can appeal to a wide variety of audiences.

Potential examples from books I've read - 

The City and the City + Perdido Street Station - China Mieville

Broken Earth Trilogy - NK Jemisin

The Name of the Wind/Wise Man's Fear - Patrick Rothfuss

GoT - Main man George

...in short - action and suspense alongside interesting but not overwrought speculative fiction.

EDIT: to clarify from the title, anything fitting in SciFi, Fantasy, or SpecFic is fair game.

Speculation regarding far future concepts,"Recently I've come up with a couple concepts for future technologies, and I would like to run them by you fine fellows to get your take. A lot of these ideas are simply new applications of already existing concepts, so naturally I'm not claiming to have come up with literally everything here. 

I would greatly appreciate it if you could point out any potential flaws in these concepts, as this stuff is quite out there.

# Quad Kugelblitz/Pion rocket hybrid

The obvious question here is ""what's the benefit to combining these two different methods of interstellar travel?"". My idea is that if you create a ring of rotating kugelblitz's^(1)  the ergosphere^(2)  of each black hole will be amplified towards the center of the array. The advantage of this is if you funnel your proton/anti-proton reaction into this region and induce some of the pions to fall into the closest kugelblitz, the remaining pions would accelerate further via the penrose process^(3). Furthermore, if you channeled the pions predominantly towards a specific black hole, the rotation of that particular kugelblitz would slow faster than the rest, essentially turning it into a massive reaction wheel. The pion stream emerging from the rear of the craft would also be gravitationally effected in such a way that would further compliment this result. 

Furthermore, a percentage of the gamma rays produced in the proton annihilation could fall into a kugelblitz and potentially begin super radiant scattering^(4). Perhaps you could accomplish this by having a meta-stable sphere of nuclear pasta^(5) suspended around each kugelblitz. The gamma rays would scatter in the gap in between the pasta and the kugelblitz. Pasta has certain phases, so my idea is that as the mass of the kugelblitz reduces due to hawking radiation the pasta would reverse phase back towards gnocchi, allowing some gamma to leave as well as more radiation and particles to fall in. The mass would increase, closing to pasta and allowing the gamma to once again begin scattering. the process would reciprocate in a form of pulsed propulsion. I have absolutely no idea if the pasta would actually behave like this, and was hoping someone could enlighten me. Even if it doesn't, this engine could function without the pasta.

Just a side tangent here, but would a naked singularity^(6) have advantages over conventional black holes? They'd probably put out more energy, but Idk.

# Unbihexium radiation shielding

Since atoms with high atomic mass are more effective at shielding radiation, it only seems natural that elements an the mythical island of stability^(7) would be effective at shielding the high levels of radiation incurred by interstellar travel. Of course this is heavily dependent on how stable these elements actually are, as well as how well they react to being bombarded during transit. 

I was inspired by [this](https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0610/0610030.pdf) paper about how radiation shielding could work. The front of the ship could have a heavy unbihexium shield,  as well as a halbach array to help shield from the magnetized component of the interstellar medium. The halbach array would also prevent the field from permeating the ship and interfering with electronics.

# G-force mitigation

As you may well know G-forces are a massive limitation to how fast you can travel. Most ships would be limited to staying close to 1 G most of the time. But what if you genetically engineered in a few extra organs to prevent blood from sloshing around? Furthermore, what if you filled cavities with fluids such as perfluorocarbons^(7)  and placed them under high pressures to prevent the fluids from rupturing organs? If this would be an effective method to raising G-Force tolerance, by how much? Could it be enough to be able to more practically launch people into space with a rail gun? Very compelling questions indeed.

# Ftl particle transmission via quantum tunneling  

This last one is more of a direct question that a concept. According to [this](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.708) paper quantum tunneling is superluminal process. Since a particle's DeBroglie wavelength encompasses the entire universe, if you could induce long distance tunneling wouldn't you be able you communicate superluminally?

Quantum entanglement has been proposed by some as a method to accomplish this (such as in *Singularity Sky* by Charles  Stross), but I think the consensus is that manipulating the particles in order to communicate would collapse the wave function and render this impossible. So it strikes me as odd that tunneling could accomplish this. It would be cool if it could though.

^(1) A black hole made of light.

^(2) A region of space-time that rotates due to the high angular momentum of a black hole. 

^(3) A process where the angular momentum of a black hole is tapped into by exchanging mass energy.

^(4) A process by which radiation becomes energized due to the angular momentum of a black hole.

^(5) Essentially the crust of a neutron star. It's hypothetically 10 billion times stronger than steel.

^(6) A naked singularity is a black hole who's ergosphere dips below the event horizon.

Could you build a shell from material on Earth around the sun?,"So, I wanted to make a couple specifications. Obviously this would be some sort of crazy material, but whatever, scifi! Also, prepare for arbitrary numbers.

* **Non-habitable**
* **1nm - 10mm thick** (originally I said 0.75mm but hey, it's sci-fi, let's have some fun!)
* **Less than 0.5 AU from the Sun**
* **Uses panels for said sphere** instead of one uniform shell; example, a 1m x 1m panel of matter 0.75mm - 10mm thick
* **Gaps between shell panels** \- I don't have a particular number, but for example: *gap of 1 meter - 1 kilometer*.
* **Material does not have to be useful or durable** (but if it can be, that'd be awesome)
* **Material must be a solid**
* **Density can range from approaching nothing to massively dense**

So, would there be enough?

Edit: This is even more ridiculous, but it'd be funny to add: 1nm thickness.

Edit: Not sure why the downvotes but hey, at least we have an answer. :)

"Looking for Story, maybe George O Smith","The story involves (a) learning a language with a vast set of phonemes and which greatly increases your intelligence. Maybe also (b) a body transformation which keeps you at an ideal weight. But I've possibly conflated those two.

I bought an ebook with some stories by George O. Smith on the basis that it had Highways In Hiding, which I connected to my searched for target. But it didn't. HIH had to do with a body transformation which could be fatal or miraculous. But there was no linguistic component nor was there an intelligence aspect.

In the same book was a story (The Fourth R) which proposed a machine which could help you memorize knowledge which then became part of your toolkit for future intellectual discovery.

But the two aspects I recall were:

First, an artificial language had been created with a multitude of phonemes, so that a huge number of words could be very short. This led to faster speech and even thinking. The ability to learn this language was an indication that you had the ability to take advantage of it.

Second, a body transformation, possibly similar to that of HIH. But the scene I recall had a woman, who had been offered the change, said that if it meant that she could eat as much as she wanted without gaining weight, she was all for it. Even as a kid in the 60s, I saw this as sexist.

The problem with HIH is that it didn't deal with weight gain. The problem with TFR is that there wasn't the implication of greater intelligence, just greater knowledge, although many may conjoin those two.","Looking for Story, maybe George O Smith The story involves (a) learning a language with a vast set of phonemes and which greatly increases your intelligence.

With all these announcements surrounding the upcoming Dune film and related merchandise.. are there any Other Frank Herbert novels anybody thinks should be adapted if it succeeds?,,With all these announcements surrounding the upcoming Dune film and related merchandise.. are there any Other Frank Herbert novels anybody thinks should be adapted if it succeeds? 
"I arranged Misty Mountains Cold (The Hobbit soundtrack) for my Cello, here is the result ! (30+ hours work)","Here is my new Cello Cover !

I am in love with Tolkien World, Lord of the Rings books, films, &amp; soundtrack. All the music from Howard Shore is absolutely beautiful &amp; I decided to arranged this song for Cello Solo.

The originally baryton singer fits perfectly with Cello Tune, &amp; the cello makes it even more sad &amp; nostalgic. I used a lot of double strings (= playing 2 strings at the same time) to make the illusion of 2 cellos playing, first one doing the theme, the second one accompanying.

I also use left hand pizzicato (3:27), while playing with bow.

This is an amateur work, but totally passionate :)

Subject: The Physics of Sci Fi Shields,"I'm posting this for a friend whose PC fried, but he'd like to get some responses sooner than later. So, I hope this is the spot to ask.

Is there a scientific basis for the type of shields depicted on sci fi shows? In a nutshell, how would such a device actually function, theoretically speaking, against the various types of threats. energy weapons, plasma, missles, projectiles, etc

How much energy would be be looking at to project that kind of a field around a ship? My assumption is that it's beyond the amount of power generation we have available, but that's just a guess.

Thanks for any input you have!","Subject: The Physics of Sci Fi Shields I'm posting this for a friend whose PC fried, but he'd like to get some responses sooner than later. So, I hope this is the spot to ask.
