How much of a difference does 0.7 mag/arcsec^2 make?,"I've had my telescope for about a year and a half now, and I am happy with it.

How do you guys confirm you’ve seen something?,"I have an 8” Dob and live under Bortle 6 skies. I’ve tried about 3 months on and off to catch a glimpse of Bode’s galaxy and the Cigar and FINALLLYYYY... over this weekend I think I saw Bode’s. I saw an elliptical blob right where it should’ve been... and saw a peculiar looking “L”-asterism of stars that I ended up finding on pictures online as well. I didn’t see the Cigar but I realized I looked at the wrong spot. Anyway... how do you guys verify you’ve seen something? 

As a side question... what other targets should I go for next? The Pinwheel and Whirlpool are in the same constellation, but I’ve heard they were much fainter. Thanks dudes!

I also wanted to get a bit weirder with it and talk about UFO sightings and hoaxes that were easily disproven or ones that were more difficult to explain.

Question about early education for a child,"So, my son has, thankfully, inherited mine and my father’s curiosity for all things space. He is six years old, and has been fascinated since about 3 years old. He is non-verbal, but has absolutely no learning delay(I know it might sound silly, but he’s the smartest child in his kindergarten class haha). He pointed out Orion, the Big and Little Dippers, and the North Star, and I know for a fact myself not his father taught him that. 

Anyway, enough with me boasting about my child, and on to the question. 

I would like to get him involved in classes where he can learn about space at a pace appropriate for his age. I live in a smaller city in northwest Ohio, and I’m not sure where to look. I am close to the Armstrong Space Museum, but it’s not as educational as I’d like.

How do you spot AD Leonis in the night sky?,"It's my friend's birthday today, and it's his sixteenth birthday. I looked around in a few star databases, and AD Leonis (Gliese 388) is almost exactly 16 light years away.

I want to call him and tell him to look for the Leo Constellation and from there look for this star, and tell that the light he's seeing from the star is just as old as him, kinda like an extra Birthday present.

I'm unable to find any photos online of where it is located relative to the rest of the constellation, for visualising. Can anyone help with how to spot this star?

He's good at spotting constellations, so don't worry about that.

Thanks.

Question on the expansion of the universe,"I saw the NEil Degrasse Tyson narrated “Dark Universe” the other day and had a question. I recall him stating that not only is the universe expanding, but it is accelerating, depending on where you are in the universe, everything appears to be expanding away from you. How is this possible?  If I am in galaxy 1, and there is a galaxy 2 between me and galaxy 3, both galaxy 2 and 3 would be moving away from me, and 2 wpuld be moving towards 3. But if I’m in galaxy 3, galaxy 2 would also be moving away from me and towards galaxy 1.

SAOImageDS9 Help?,"Hi, so I’m a student in college currently trying to figure out how to use the given program in the title which is commonly used in astronomy for educational purposes, and I was wondering if anyone else was having trouble using shapes in the program, or better yet, if there was a solution to the problem. It’s needed for a lab that I’m doing where I need to be able to use the Line function in order to measure the diameter of a given nebula and then use that diameter and other factors to find the volume of said nebula. I’m able to open everything up to the Line function (Region -&gt; Shape -&gt; Line), but when I click Line, though it’s indicated that it’s selected, it doesn’t perform the function when I click and drag as it’s supposed to. It’s not the variation of the program itself, as I have now downloaded it onto a Mac and even a library desktop to no avail. To make matters worse, all of the FAQs and help guides on the program are of no help, either just saying to do what I have already done or referencing the Command Line whenever I use the word “Line” in my individual searches. I hope that someone on this sub is able to help, though it’s an obscure problem on a probably not-very popular program. Nonetheless, any help is much appreciated!","SAOImageDS9 Help?

Request for Sources on Stellar Nucleosynthesis,"Hi all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in an introductory astronomy class and writing a term paper on stellar nucleosynthesis. This is a lofty subject for an intro class, but my professor urged the class to choose a topic that interested us rather than a topic that we thought he would like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the basics; that under extreme heat and pressure elemental composition of atoms is changed. In early stars this was Hydrogen to Helium, and in later stellar generations, more massive elements were formed, up until Iron. I'm focusing the paper on why Iron is the most massive element that can be synthesized within a stellar core, and then briefly on how the heavier elements are formed (supernovae). 

&amp;#x200B;

Given how far over my head the topic is, I'm struggling to find sources that I can understand and utilize. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","Request for Sources on Stellar Nucleosynthesis Hi all.

Sunmoonclock: An interactive calendar,"I wanted to share a little interactive application called ""Sunmoonclock"" that my friend and I had created over a year ago, but never shared because I felt it was a little buggy and missing some features. Even though more needs to be done to get it to a 2.0 version, I felt I may as well get it out in the world and see what people think.

I designed this to not only display sunrise/set and moonrise/set times, but to illustrate the phases of the moon as well as changes in length of days over the course of a year. The main bit of playfulness is going backward or forward in time and watching how things shift depending on your latitude. As far as interactivity, we created this to be as simple as possible while also making sure it worked on mobile devices.

Is it possible to measure redshift of deep sky objects with a 5k USD budget?,"Hi guys,

I am fascinated by the expansion of the universe and the Hubble constant.

Is it possible to show that a closer object has a smaller redshift than a object farther away as an amateur with a 5k USD budget?

I am not talking about a precise measurement but about showing that the principle of cosmic expansion applies.

What would be the simplest experimental amateur setup that could achieve this?

Thanks for input and ideas!

Today the northern lights from Wednesday’s sun explosion are at their peak.,"I live in the Oslo area in Norway where there is quite a bit of light pollution. We are in the Kp5 zone and the strength of today’s aurora is at Kp7 at its highest between 18-21. The weather is very clear and I’m super hyped however I don’t know if I’ll be able to see anything.

Edit: to everyone still reading this post. I’ve been out and we didn’t get to see it. Sun set way too late but doubt there would be anything anyways. Auroras are really hit or miss but today the chances were a little higher. To everyone that saw it hope u enjoyed it cause it’s something I really do wanna see one time. We had a nice time out at least in Sørkedalen and the sky was clear and starry. Got some nice pictures of andromeda and the less bright part of the Milky Way.

"Guide me, I feel like i'm missing something.","So, I have read Stephen Hawking's books and watched several documentaries on the different topics of space. In no way do I believe that I am anywhere near the level of an astronomer or physicist but after reading so much about how we know what distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies are made of... I have started to grow doubts. 

   See, in the beginning if the entire universe was a singularity and then the ""big bang"" occurred which spread matter all across what we call the universe today, is it reasonable to believe that all elements were homogeneous in being spread throughout the universe? I don't think that earth alone, or even our solar system, would hold any real amount of every single element in existence. Is my logic flawed? 

   Reading many books, I have noticed that astronomers will state something about a star being compromised of some gas and they ""know"" this due to a red shift or blue shift which is caused by one chemical or another. How do we know that there are not other elements that are unknown to us here that also create those color shifts? It seems to me that with the vastness of space and our limited exposure that the must be a large amount of unknown materials spread throughout the universe. Seeing as we know nothing about these materials, how can we claim to know something about a star which sits at a great distance? 

Science changes its standpoint on things that are here on our planet that is readily accessible as we learn more. I find it difficult to say with any certainty of the composition of celestial bodies.

Lagrangian points and halo orbits,"Hello all, 
Can anyone explain how Lagrangian points work and how objects can orbit them? From my understanding, Lagrangian points are points in space at which gravitational and centripetal forces balance to keep an object in a stable position in relation to the sun and planet. But since they are just points in space and do not have any gravity of their own, how can we insert satellites into halo orbits around L1 and L2? Why wouldn't a satellite just stay at the point itself and orbit the sun in conjunction with Earth?","Lagrangian points and halo orbits Hello all,

Accounting for non linearity when measuring distance in space,"A simplified version of my question is this: how can we consider x light years or y parsecs an accurate measurement of distance when you cannot measure in a straight line? This is vague so I will elaborate below

I will note that my understanding of mathematical principles relating to space is limited. I’m a university student in chemistry so I can take a bit of science jargon, but keep in mind everything is really little in my studies. 

I first thought of this question after learning about Einstein’s  general theory of relativity, how spacetime curves around massive objectives and how space and time are not really separate, as I understood it. I’ve found the equation of light years and I didn’t understand it so I wasted a lot of time looking things up from that angle. Then I found that astronomers don’t really take measurement in light years, that’s more of an outdated measurement that only Hollywood uses now (true?), it’s parsecs that are relevant. Also didn’t understand the equation for parsecs. Attended a public lecture on gravitational waves and asked the speaker my question... I must not have communicated what I meant or he thought I wanted to know in relation to gravitational waves. Gravitational waves really only added to my confusion. I’ve learned a bit about lensing and the accuracy of predicting how old stars are via electromagnetic radiation. 

The resources I’ve found so far oversimplify to basic general relativity or assume I’m an astrophysicist and don’t answer my question so perhaps it’s too obvious. I just don’t get how space distances can be accurate since they’re not in a straight line, and since measurements rely on time, how general relativity is accounted for since the further from earth, the slower the time (in relation to earth) and so the greater the distance??

Why is it that the earth will not eventually make it's way to the sun?,If space/time curves and bends around massive objects like stars (and that is why planets revolve around them) then why is it that the earth will not eventually orbit closer and closer until it crashes into the sun?  In classic bedsheet examples the marbles eventually will of course crash into the heavy object in the center of the sheet.  ,Why is it that the earth will not eventually make it's way to the sun?

Milky Way Galaxy Maps,"Hello, Knowledgable Astronomers of Reddit!

Apologies if this is not the place to ask this question, I don't actually use Reddit very often. Just let me know and I'll move it elsewhere.

Anyway, I -- because I am a giant nerd -- am running a roleplaying game taking place some arbitrary amount of time into the future. The entire Terran solar system is gone (thanks, Cthulhu), so I need to figure out a bunch of places where humanity can set up shop. I'm trying to find a bunch of different solar systems that are sort of near each other where I can put different civilizations, etc.

I found a site called galaxymap.org which seems like it has the sort of things I need, but I'm running into a problem: the galaxy, it turns out, is really, really, really, REALLY big. Even if I try to pick a space close to earth to start (and I'm not sure I'm even doing that right) I just have no idea how to go about this.

I'm wondering if any of you guys have any pointers? Pretty much anything would be of help, as right now I'm as lost as a... umm... I dunno. Some sort of space metaphor for being really lost.

Thanks so much!

Info on Franc Holden,"I am not too sure if I am posting this in the correct category or not but here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

A little while back I was bored and I wanted to see if any famous people had died on the day I was born. A quick google search and the name Franc Holden popped up, mentioned he was famous for his work and research conducive to binary stars. This jumped out at me because ever since I could remember I told my mom that I was going to be an astronomer so I sensed an odd connection between myself and Franc Holden so of course I wanted to do some more research on the guy. I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE THING ABOUT HIM. He was mentioned on a list of famous peoples death but yet there is nothing but a short obituary that I can find online. I just have a feeling that in some odd, mystical, random way that Mr. Holden and I are connected. I actually sent an email to his surviving daughter who is a professor at a university in Maine or New Hampshire (somewhere up North East) but she did not respond. If anyone could find some information on him that would be greatly appreciated - I would love to learn more about his work and accomplishments!","Info on Franc Holden I am not too sure if I am posting this in the correct category or not but here it goes.

Calculating the eccentricity or minor axis of an orbit using light curve data,"I'm designing an assignment for my students (freshmen year waves and modern physics) where they have to access light curves and radial velocity data from the NASA website taken from mostly Kepler and K2. I'm not an expert in this domain, but I find it really interesting and I think the students would love it.

I found how to calculate almost everything, but the only variable I have left to figure out is the eccentricity of the orbit. I know that it depends on the semi major and minor axis of the elliptical orbit, but then how do I determine the semi minor axis? 

I need the eccentricity to calculate Mp*sin(i) and the radial velocity semi amplitude of the star. 

Thanks!","Calculating the eccentricity or minor axis of an orbit using light curve data I'm designing an assignment for my students (freshmen year waves and modern physics) where they have to access light curves and radial velocity data from the NASA website taken from mostly Kepler and K2.

Filters,"I have no interest in astrophotography. I will admire greatly the pictures of all the astrophotographers on the interwebs. However I love stargazing. The problem is that I live in the Pacific Northwest of the US and we have rainy or cloudy skies most of the year. Are there any filters or equipment I can get that can filter out clouds or haze that are accessible for a novice? I can stomach spending up to $2-3k so that's a considerable chunk of change but not tens of thousands.

I guess what I'm asking is, if you don't have access to clear dark skies and you are not a professional astronomer what are your options for star gazing?

What is longitude mean?,"**Edit:** Sorry for butchering the titles. I went from ""What is longitude"" to ""What does longitude mean?""

I'm not an astronomer but just a physical scientist trying to understand the terminology of celestial mechanics. Here is a picture that appears in Oliver's Pioneers of Science book:

https://imgur.com/a/q7HMrkm

On the vertical axis, you see that it labels it as 

&gt; *""the difference between observed and subsequently calculated longitudes""*. 

I'm trying to understand (i) what does longitude mean? (ii) how is longitude calculated from a physical observation on Earth? 

I understand the notion of: 

1. [Longitude of the periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_periapsis)

2. [True longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_longitude)

So essentially the true longitude is equal to the true anomaly plus the longitude of the periapsis. 

However, I'm still confused about what the ""longitude"" means in the context of the graphic? How was it measured, and how is it related to the longitudes above? I'm sure there must be a simple answer to this, but I've been googling ""longitude"" for an hour-or-so and there are so many different definitions. 

One possibility is that longitude is in the context of the celestial sphere. That is, produce the celestial sphere and measure the angle between the celestial body and a reference location. This is the longitude as referred to above. [See video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Toya19H12w). 

If this is true, then I am still confused how this 'observed' longitude corresponds to the ""true longitude"" defined above.","What is longitude mean? **Edit:** Sorry for butchering the titles. I went from ""What is longitude"" to ""What does longitude mean?""

Is it something we would notice if we weren’t looking for it?

Jupiter's atmosphere evolution of 1 year through amatorial telescopes,"To  understand the **atmosphere evolution** of Jupiter we need to analyze very long time lapse, so we can see that the major structure are moving each other in different direction and transforming . The mere fact that the planet rotates in 10 hours , and that there are no points of reference can be deceiving  and only comparing two pictures taken in different months, we realize  that something has changed. Add also the weather and day/night variables and get it clear in reality is not so easy.I love transiet events, so I decided several years ago to make that evident but with data that also an amatorial telescope can collect and not with a computer simulation or cassini images.

To follow  this movement we need a point to use as reference on this **gas surface**  where everything move and change. The Great Red Spot was perfect for  this purpose, everyone know it and is just big enought.

I spent several days of  2013 on this project but the work was huge and I spent a lot of time collecting enought data to fill all the temporal holes and I gradually completed. I contacted several  imagers like me to have enought data because I needed jupiter at all  the hours of the day, even with the sun at my  longitude.

When I had enought to start I  selected and divided all the captures in range of 3 days and using photoshop I nornalized the contrast,  gamma, color correction and resolution of each one to make them more uniform. I tryed to have 4-6 pictures for each map I wanted to build, images produced by amatorial instruments.I  collected images of Jupiters in different hours of the day to cover all  the rotation of the planet, then I used WinJupos  to link the time/space coordinate to the captured files so that the software knows when and where of each pixels. Then I build a unique rectangular map using few pixel for each original capture,  making verification that the data I received was correct (not always).

When I finished all the cylindrical map I fixed my meridian of reference on the  **Great Red Spot**, aligned all the stack images and built an animation on **Photoshop/WinJupos**.

After several  weeks I finally reached the final timelapse, it was 6 years ago but I think is still of some value.

But you must not stop only to that, images are made of data that can be studied. Always with WinJupos (a great software) you can analyze the movements of all the structures that are evident, measure their velocity and see that the ovals passing next the GRS change their velocity slowing down or accelerating  coming into contact with the turbulence caused by the red spot.   We can also derive the actual dimensions of the different formations.

Thinking that today you can achieve with a little 'commitment from the courtyard of your home amateur analysis of this kind should ignite curiosity in every amateur.

 Does anyone use a telescope with an app called SkyPortal. I owm a Celestron Cosmos 90gt wifi telescope and i need to use the mobile app ""SkyPortal"" in order to control and align it.


So the problem im having is that when im gonna align it i dont find anyway to reset the last alignment and when i try to do it over it says something like "" alingment position 4/10"" when i just started it.... And when i select that position it tells me its too far from the location from the telescope. :( I need help please

Questions about Earth's precession,"I have been studying astronomy at home by myself and I can't wrap my head around understanding the Earth's precession (even after trying to figure it out using google and my astronomy book). I understand that a tropical year is \~365.2422 solar days and a sidereal year is \~365.256 solar days so there is about a 20 minute difference.  

\- Does this mean that constellations are slowly moving eastward, kind of ""falling back"" at a rate of 20 mins a year? E.g. Orion would rise 20 mins later every year on the same calendar day?

\- How do leap-years come into play?  (If they have any effect at all on this?) 

\- My astronomy book states that Orion will be a summer constellation in 13000 years. Could anyone explain the math behind this? It is probably a bad example as a complete cycle of precession is 26000 years and so if it is now a winter constellation (in the northern hemisphere) I kind of expect it to be a summer constellation half-way through the cycle. Is it as simple as assuming 26000 years is a 360° circle and calculating proportions if I want to calculate this for other constellations? What is the relationship between the 26000 year period and the 20 minutes difference per day?

&amp;#x200B;

Question about the theoretical perceived brightness of planets,"I always wonder how bright planets like Jupiter, Saturn ... Pluto would appear if we observed them around their respective orbits.


Since light intensity falls off with 1/r² they should be much darker than Junos and Cassinis images show us, I guess. Or maybe I don't give our sun enough credit in illuminating our celestial bodies and the images we are used to see through the eyes of the
space probes superior sensors are closer to reality than I think.


Makes me wonder.","Question about the theoretical perceived brightness of planets I always wonder how bright planets like Jupiter, Saturn ... Pluto would appear if we observed them around their respective orbits.

Question regarding Astrobiology,"I am a high school student, (not trying to brag but my grades are high, I have recieved top student). I enjoy math and astronomy, I also enjoy biology and I am enrolled in that for next year. I am not 100 percent sure my career path, so I find biology is good, especially if I decide on medicine which I am considering. My university has astronomy programs as well. If I did biology with astronomy courses that could lead down the path to astrobiology, right? This is an area where frankly, I'm very interested in. However I do not know how hard it is to get a job in this area( I know they are limited). Is this a career that is good to directly pursue? Or should I focus on medicine / pharmaceuticals ( which I also like, maybe not quite as much), because there are also more jobs in these, and keep astrobiologist in the background. Because I also do not want to get a degree and end up working a minimum wage job because I cannot find work ( and no offence to anyone who works a minimum wage job, I am currently working one part time myself :) ).","Question regarding Astrobiology I am a high school student, (not trying to brag but my grades are high, I have recieved top student).

The California Nebula (Multiple nights of imaging with a camera and telescope),"&amp;#x200B;

This vibrant beauty starts out high in the sky at nightfall at this time of year (In the northern hemisphere). If you can locate Pleiades, NGC 1499 is not far away. 

I remember gasping as I watched the exposure finish on my (newly modified) DSLR through an 80mm telescope the first time I photographed this nebula.

[The California Nebula captured from my backyard in the city \(Bortle Class 8\)](https://i.redd.it/kvoj5s3cqke21.jpg)

Several years, and countless imaging sessions later, and I still travel back to that moment whenever I see it. 🌌

This image features a mash-up of data from multiple cameras and telescopes (I know, helpful right?).

The majority of data was captured using the Meade 70mm Quad refractor with my  Canon T3i for color, with some much needed Ha details thrown in, including data shot in October through an Esprit 100 with a duo-narrowband filter.

I went TO TOWN on the processing. As a whole, I love it - but in reality the stars are little chewed.

Can someone explain this elliptical resonance gif to me?,"So ""The Dance of the Earth and Venus Around the Sun"" is going around Reddit.

It makes for a pretty image of course. But looking at it, I can't figure out if there is anything deciding the spirograph, or if it's just a random line to make the gif interesting.

Where could I find a list of real star data to simulate an HR Diagram with my astronomy students?,"Hello /r/Astronomy 

I'm planning to make an activity for my students that consists of a blank log-log graph, and each one of them has one or a couple of stars, along with its properties. And one by one they begin charting the real stars to hopefully reach the same conclusions of the stellar evolution (Main sequence, giants, etc.). I think it would be a fun task for school level kids.

I have thought of generating the list in python with some simulated data that ressembles the HR, but I think it is better if I can directly download real stellar information. They are about 300 kids, so I think a list of that length would be enough.","Where could I find a list of real star data to simulate an HR Diagram with my astronomy students? Hello /r/Astronomy

Need help understanding Newtons The Crime of Ptolemy,"Hi everyone.  
I am writing a paper for University about the fraud-allegations against Ptolemy over time. I am a history student and dont know much about astronomy.  
Right now i am reading The Crime of Ptolemy by R.R. Newton and there is this passage i don't understand. Here he wants to proof that Ptolemy fabricated some of his observations. He proposes the following method:  


First we locate genuine observations made by other astronomers that are relevant to the theories that Ptolemy wants to establish with the aid of his own observations. Next we find the parameters in Ptolemy's theories by using the observations made by others, and we calculate the **circumstance** of Ptolemy's alleged observations from his theories, using these parameters to do so. Finally we compare the calculated **circumstances** with those which Ptolemy claims to have observed. In many cases, the calculated and ""observed"" **circumstances** agree to every digit that Ptolemy writes down. \[...\]  


What does circumstance mean here?   
Is it like a astronmy-specific term? I googled that and could not find anything.  
English is not my native language, maybe this could be the problem too, but all the translations of circumstance dont make any sense in this context.  


Any help would be much appreciated. ","Need help understanding Newtons The Crime of Ptolemy Hi everyone.

Expanding Universe?," 

Explain it like I'm 5.

I don't know anything about astronomy/astrophysics, but a question came to me today about the expanding universe while watching Joe Rogan get mentally wrecked by Brian Cox. How do we know, or what reason do we have to believe, that the universe is expanding? In what direction and away from what focal point? Can we point to a position in the sky and say ""there, that's where all the stuff is moving away from""? Or do we just see all things moving in one direction ""away"" from some indeterminate ""X"" position?

But my real question is how could we deduce that that is, in fact, a focal point or ""wave-in-one-direction"" if all we have is the observable universe? Couldn't we just as easily say that the observable universe is expanding as one among, perhaps, millions of other either centrifugal ""bubbles"" or waves (or whatever) within the larger universe?

Sorry if my question is dumb or naive. But it is genuine.","Expanding Universe?

"Need anyone with a &gt;5 inch telescope from Washington/northern Idaho/Wyoming for an occultation on 2019/02/16, no experience required!","Hey everyone, after the (somewhat successful) observation of the asteroid 2015 TG387 on October 20, I would like to once again ask publically if anyone is interested and available to observe a new object: the unusual asteroid 944 Hidalgo. Just to give some background, it's a very strange asteroid whose orbit takes it from just inside the asteroid belt to almost the orbit of Saturn. It has a strangely comet-like orbit, and scientists think that it used to be a comet at some point that already lost all of its ice and dust.

In the early morning of February 16, just after it reached its closest point to the sun in October, Hidalgo will appear to pass almost exactly in front of a 10th-magnitude star, blocking its light out for up to 5 seconds in a phenomenon called an occultation. By observing it and measuring how long the light remains blocked out for, we can construct the apparent shape of the asteroid to a much higher accuracy than any other method can give us except just flying a spacecraft over.

It's currently thought that Hidalgo might be a contact binary, like the recently explored 2014 MU69/Ultima thule, but that can't be confirmed until we can tell what its shape is, something that the 2019/02/16 occultation could tell us if we get enough observers.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the asteroid's fairly small size (about 50-60 kilometers), the 'shadow' it will cast from the star is only 50-60 kilometers across, and extends over a small area of Vancouver island, northern Washington, northern Idaho, southern Montana, and Wyoming, before its shadow passes over the eastern US, where dawn will already be starting. Is anyone in that area available to get up around 5:30 AM on February 16 to help us learn more about the nature of the asteroid Hidalgo?","Need anyone with a &gt;5 inch telescope from Washington/northern Idaho/Wyoming for an occultation on 2019/02/16, no experience required!

Ancient Astronomy. Interesting Stories and Facts?,"Okay. I'm trying to write a book on Astronomy, and how it has evolved over the years. And I've got some solid content on the Middle section, (with Galileo, Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, etc) and Modern Astronomy, with Relativity, Stephen Hawking and his work on Black Holes, and Carl Sagan.

I'm struck with what to write in the Early Astronomy section. I know it was mostly studying constellations, and geocentric theories by a lot of Greek, Arab, and Indian philosophers.  Some philosophers came up with early evidence of Spherical Earth and Heliocentrisim. But what I'm struck with, is that I'm not able to find any particularly interesting stories to being with.

Are there any interesting stories with any person coming up with constellations, or studying them? 

I'm not finding any good event or story like that to start off the book. 

I need to do research if I have to get somewhere with the book, and I'm willing to do that.  Can anyone give some pointers on where to research?

Possible for two planets to orbit in perfect synchronization?,"I'm writing a fantasy novel and I want to know whether an idea I have is physically possible (it's fine if it's highly unlikely).

The idea I have is this:

&amp;#x200B;

SUN ---------- PLANET1 ---------- PLANET2

&amp;#x200B;

And Planet 1 and Planet 2 would have their orbit around the sun perfectly synchronized. Meaning, Planet 1 would always be directly between the sun and planet 2. In addition to that, I would like to know if it's possibly for it to appear to inhabitants on planet 1 that planet 2 was a ring in the sky because the shadow of planet 1 on planet 2.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is possible, what would the basic requirements of relative size and distance of the two celestial bodies? Particularly assuming that planet 1 was inhabitable. I would like it if planet 2 were in habitable as well, but it does not have to be if it's physically impossible.

Question about early education for a child,"So, my son has, thankfully, inherited mine and my father’s curiosity for all things space. He is six years old, and has been fascinated since about 3 years old.

He pointed out Orion, the Big and Little Dippers, and the North Star, and I know for a fact myself not his father taught him that. 

Anyway, enough with me boasting about my child, and on to the question. 

I would like to get him involved in classes where he can learn about space at a pace appropriate for his age. I live in a smaller city in northwest Ohio, and I’m not sure where to look. I am close to the Armstrong Space Museum, but it’s not as educational as I’d like.

How do you spot AD Leonis in the night sky?,"It's my friend's birthday today, and it's his sixteenth birthday. I looked around in a few star databases, and AD Leonis (Gliese 388) is almost exactly 16 light years away.

He's good at spotting constellations, so don't worry about that.

I’m able to open everything up to the Line function (Region -&gt; Shape -&gt; Line), but when I click Line, though it’s indicated that it’s selected, it doesn’t perform the function when I click and drag as it’s supposed to.

Request for Sources on Stellar Nucleosynthesis,"Hi all.

I'm in an introductory astronomy class and writing a term paper on stellar nucleosynthesis. This is a lofty subject for an intro class, but my professor urged the class to choose a topic that interested us rather than a topic that we thought he would like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the basics; that under extreme heat and pressure elemental composition of atoms is changed. In early stars this was Hydrogen to Helium, and in later stellar generations, more massive elements were formed, up until Iron. I'm focusing the paper on why Iron is the most massive element that can be synthesized within a stellar core, and then briefly on how the heavier elements are formed (supernovae).

However, since its my first time i'm a bit lost. I never took a photo of any other galaxy (not even Andromeda) and I only took a picture of the orion nebula, and that was without a T-ring (now i have one)  


So, what is the best way to approach this galaxy? I have a canon 550d/T2i, Skywatcher 130/600 scope. Skywatcher HEQ5 mount and thats about it. (Before you say to try to attempt a closer object, I want to aim big and to see what I can achieve right now)"
Sunmoonclock: An interactive calendar,"I wanted to share a little interactive application called ""Sunmoonclock"" that my friend and I had created over a year ago, but never shared because I felt it was a little buggy and missing some features. Even though more needs to be done to get it to a 2.0 version, I felt I may as well get it out in the world and see what people think.

I designed this to not only display sunrise/set and moonrise/set times, but to illustrate the phases of the moon as well as changes in length of days over the course of a year. The main bit of playfulness is going backward or forward in time and watching how things shift depending on your latitude. As far as interactivity, we created this to be as simple as possible while also making sure it worked on mobile devices.

**Only thing is, this post gets automatically banned every time I add the website url.** How do I share it with everybody here?

Is it possible to measure redshift of deep sky objects with a 5k USD budget?,"Hi guys,

I am fascinated by the expansion of the universe and the Hubble constant.

Is it possible to show that a closer object has a smaller redshift than a object farther away as an amateur with a 5k USD budget?

I am not talking about a precise measurement but about showing that the principle of cosmic expansion applies.

What would be the simplest experimental amateur setup that could achieve this?

Thanks for input and ideas!

Today the northern lights from Wednesday’s sun explosion are at their peak.,"I live in the Oslo area in Norway where there is quite a bit of light pollution.

Edit: to everyone still reading this post. I’ve been out and we didn’t get to see it. Sun set way too late but doubt there would be anything anyways. Auroras are really hit or miss but today the chances were a little higher. To everyone that saw it hope u enjoyed it cause it’s something I really do wanna see one time.

"Guide me, I feel like i'm missing something.","So, I have read Stephen Hawking's books and watched several documentaries on the different topics of space. In no way do I believe that I am anywhere near the level of an astronomer or physicist but after reading so much about how we know what distant stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies are made of... I have started to grow doubts. 

   See, in the beginning if the entire universe was a singularity and then the ""big bang"" occurred which spread matter all across what we call the universe today, is it reasonable to believe that all elements were homogeneous in being spread throughout the universe? I don't think that earth alone, or even our solar system, would hold any real amount of every single element in existence. Is my logic flawed? 

   Reading many books, I have noticed that astronomers will state something about a star being compromised of some gas and they ""know"" this due to a red shift or blue shift which is caused by one chemical or another. How do we know that there are not other elements that are unknown to us here that also create those color shifts? It seems to me that with the vastness of space and our limited exposure that the must be a large amount of unknown materials spread throughout the universe. Seeing as we know nothing about these materials, how can we claim to know something about a star which sits at a great distance? 

Science changes its standpoint on things that are here on our planet that is readily accessible as we learn more. I find it difficult to say with any certainty of the composition of celestial bodies.

I have a group of seniors taking physics (not an AP or a college-credit course, just for “fun”) and we’ve nearly finished all of the necessary mechanics from the curriculum. I’ve given them to opportunity to choose our topic for the 4th quarter, and instead of looking at further topics in physics, they’ve decided they want to learn about astronomy. Since I studied astronomy/astrophysics in college, I’m psyched, but I’m not sure what to cover.      

I will see these students for 7 weeks during the 4th quarter (due to graduation being before the end of the quarter), for ~3-4 hours per week. They all have a good handle on algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, but not calculus. So, I’m coming to you, astronomy buffs of Reddit, to ask which topics do you think I should teach to these students? What do you think is “most important” in astronomy?"

Accounting for non linearity when measuring distance in space,"A simplified version of my question is this: how can we consider x light years or y parsecs an accurate measurement of distance when you cannot measure in a straight line? This is vague so I will elaborate below

I will note that my understanding of mathematical principles relating to space is limited. I’m a university student in chemistry so I can take a bit of science jargon, but keep in mind everything is really little in my studies. 

I first thought of this question after learning about Einstein’s  general theory of relativity, how spacetime curves around massive objectives and how space and time are not really separate, as I understood it. I’ve found the equation of light years and I didn’t understand it so I wasted a lot of time looking things up from that angle. Then I found that astronomers don’t really take measurement in light years, that’s more of an outdated measurement that only Hollywood uses now (true?), it’s parsecs that are relevant. Also didn’t understand the equation for parsecs. Attended a public lecture on gravitational waves and asked the speaker my question... I must not have communicated what I meant or he thought I wanted to know in relation to gravitational waves. Gravitational waves really only added to my confusion. I’ve learned a bit about lensing and the accuracy of predicting how old stars are via electromagnetic radiation. 

The resources I’ve found so far oversimplify to basic general relativity or assume I’m an astrophysicist and don’t answer my question so perhaps it’s too obvious. I just don’t get how space distances can be accurate since they’re not in a straight line, and since measurements rely on time, how general relativity is accounted for since the further from earth, the slower the time (in relation to earth) and so the greater the distance??

Please help I’ve been stuck on this on and off for like two years now. Even pointing me towards some resources for learning without the heavy mathematics would be greatly appreciated!","Accounting for non linearity when measuring distance in space A simplified version of my question is this: how can we consider x light years or y parsecs an accurate measurement of distance when you cannot measure in a straight line?

Milky Way Galaxy Maps,"Hello, Knowledgable Astronomers of Reddit!

Apologies if this is not the place to ask this question, I don't actually use Reddit very often. Just let me know and I'll move it elsewhere.

Anyway, I -- because I am a giant nerd -- am running a roleplaying game taking place some arbitrary amount of time into the future. The entire Terran solar system is gone (thanks, Cthulhu), so I need to figure out a bunch of places where humanity can set up shop. I'm trying to find a bunch of different solar systems that are sort of near each other where I can put different civilizations, etc.

I found a site called galaxymap.org which seems like it has the sort of things I need, but I'm running into a problem: the galaxy, it turns out, is really, really, really, REALLY big. Even if I try to pick a space close to earth to start (and I'm not sure I'm even doing that right) I just have no idea how to go about this.

I'm wondering if any of you guys have any pointers? Pretty much anything would be of help, as right now I'm as lost as a... umm... I dunno. Some sort of space metaphor for being really lost.

Thanks so much!

I just have a feeling that in some odd, mystical, random way that Mr. Holden and I are connected.

Calculating the eccentricity or minor axis of an orbit using light curve data,"I'm designing an assignment for my students (freshmen year waves and modern physics) where they have to access light curves and radial velocity data from the NASA website taken from mostly Kepler and K2. I'm not an expert in this domain, but I find it really interesting and I think the students would love it.

I found how to calculate almost everything, but the only variable I have left to figure out is the eccentricity of the orbit. I know that it depends on the semi major and minor axis of the elliptical orbit, but then how do I determine the semi minor axis? 

I need the eccentricity to calculate Mp*sin(i) and the radial velocity semi amplitude of the star.

Filters,"I have no interest in astrophotography. I will admire greatly the pictures of all the astrophotographers on the interwebs. However I love stargazing. The problem is that I live in the Pacific Northwest of the US and we have rainy or cloudy skies most of the year. Are there any filters or equipment I can get that can filter out clouds or haze that are accessible for a novice? I can stomach spending up to $2-3k so that's a considerable chunk of change but not tens of thousands.

I guess what I'm asking is, if you don't have access to clear dark skies and you are not a professional astronomer what are your options for star gazing?

What is longitude mean?,"**Edit:** Sorry for butchering the titles. I went from ""What is longitude"" to ""What does longitude mean?""

I'm not an astronomer but just a physical scientist trying to understand the terminology of celestial mechanics. Here is a picture that appears in Oliver's Pioneers of Science book:

https://imgur.com/a/q7HMrkm

On the vertical axis, you see that it labels it as 

&gt; *""the difference between observed and subsequently calculated longitudes""*. 

I'm trying to understand (i) what does longitude mean? (ii) how is longitude calculated from a physical observation on Earth? 

I understand the notion of: 

1. [Longitude of the periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_periapsis)

2. [True longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_longitude)

So essentially the true longitude is equal to the true anomaly plus the longitude of the periapsis. 

However, I'm still confused about what the ""longitude"" means in the context of the graphic? How was it measured, and how is it related to the longitudes above? I'm sure there must be a simple answer to this, but I've been googling ""longitude"" for an hour-or-so and there are so many different definitions. 

One possibility is that longitude is in the context of the celestial sphere. That is, produce the celestial sphere and measure the angle between the celestial body and a reference location. This is the longitude as referred to above. [See video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Toya19H12w). 

If this is true, then I am still confused how this 'observed' longitude corresponds to the ""true longitude"" defined above.","What is longitude mean? **Edit:** Sorry for butchering the titles. I went from ""What is longitude"" to ""What does longitude mean?""

I'm having trouble finding good resources for learning the basics after I'm done with that. I'm comfortable with something a bit more rigorous but would really like something with a practical focus since I'm not looking to change careers, just take up amateur astronomy as a hobby.","Learning resources beyond the basics I'm almost done with Christ Impey's Coursera course on Astronomy, which is highly conceptual but overall a decent introduction to the topic.

"(Bloodborne) Astronomers, is this a real representation of celestial time, right ascension, or sidereal time?","Hi, astronomers. Quick question.

Bloodborne was a videogame released on playstation 4. It features a celestial clock, which is always set to a specific time, this:

Later, it will move to this position, revealing a secret:

Is it possible to calculate either the celestial time, right ascension, or sidereal time from either picture, and is there any celestial significance to these values?

This is probably the one time I wish I took an astronomy class.

Jupiter's atmosphere evolution of 1 year through amatorial telescopes,"To  understand the **atmosphere evolution** of Jupiter we need to analyze very long time lapse, so we can see that the major structure are moving each other in different direction and transforming . The mere fact that the planet rotates in 10 hours , and that there are no points of reference can be deceiving  and only comparing two pictures taken in different months, we realize  that something has changed. Add also the weather and day/night variables and get it clear in reality is not so easy.I love transiet events, so I decided several years ago to make that evident but with data that also an amatorial telescope can collect and not with a computer simulation or cassini images.

To follow  this movement we need a point to use as reference on this **gas surface**  where everything move and change. The Great Red Spot was perfect for  this purpose, everyone know it and is just big enought.

I spent several days of  2013 on this project but the work was huge and I spent a lot of time collecting enought data to fill all the temporal holes and I gradually completed. I contacted several  imagers like me to have enought data because I needed jupiter at all  the hours of the day, even with the sun at my  longitude.

When I had enought to start I  selected and divided all the captures in range of 3 days and using photoshop I nornalized the contrast,  gamma, color correction and resolution of each one to make them more uniform. I tryed to have 4-6 pictures for each map I wanted to build, images produced by amatorial instruments.I  collected images of Jupiters in different hours of the day to cover all  the rotation of the planet, then I used WinJupos  to link the time/space coordinate to the captured files so that the software knows when and where of each pixels. Then I build a unique rectangular map using few pixel for each original capture,  making verification that the data I received was correct (not always).

When I finished all the cylindrical map I fixed my meridian of reference on the  **Great Red Spot**, aligned all the stack images and built an animation on **Photoshop/WinJupos**.

After several  weeks I finally reached the final timelapse, it was 6 years ago but I think is still of some value.

But you must not stop only to that, images are made of data that can be studied. Always with WinJupos (a great software) you can analyze the movements of all the structures that are evident, measure their velocity and see that the ovals passing next the GRS change their velocity slowing down or accelerating  coming into contact with the turbulence caused by the red spot.   We can also derive the actual dimensions of the different formations.

Thinking that today you can achieve with a little 'commitment from the courtyard of your home amateur analysis of this kind should ignite curiosity in every amateur.

Questions about Earth's precession,"I have been studying astronomy at home by myself and I can't wrap my head around understanding the Earth's precession (even after trying to figure it out using google and my astronomy book). I understand that a tropical year is \~365.2422 solar days and a sidereal year is \~365.256 solar days so there is about a 20 minute difference.  

\- Does this mean that constellations are slowly moving eastward, kind of ""falling back"" at a rate of 20 mins a year? E.g. Orion would rise 20 mins later every year on the same calendar day?

\- How do leap-years come into play?  (If they have any effect at all on this?) 

\- My astronomy book states that Orion will be a summer constellation in 13000 years. Could anyone explain the math behind this? It is probably a bad example as a complete cycle of precession is 26000 years and so if it is now a winter constellation (in the northern hemisphere) I kind of expect it to be a summer constellation half-way through the cycle. Is it as simple as assuming 26000 years is a 360° circle and calculating proportions if I want to calculate this for other constellations? What is the relationship between the 26000 year period and the 20 minutes difference per day?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a way to calculate the actual Roche limit for certain satellite orbiting certain planet?,"I know there's a rigid Roche limit and a fluid Roche limit, and I know that in real life the Roche limit for certain celestial body orbiting another celestial body is between the rigid one and the fluid one (since no celestial bodies are either total rigid or total fluid). Yet I can't seem to find out how to calculate THE real value of Roche limits in certain cases. 

Say I want Earth to orbit Jupiter. I know that the rigid limit is about 0.78 R\_J and the fluid limit is about 1.51 R\_J. Now is there a way I can calculate the actual Roche limit in this case?

Question about the theoretical perceived brightness of planets,"I always wonder how bright planets like Jupiter, Saturn ... Pluto would appear if we observed them around their respective orbits.

space probes superior sensors are closer to reality than I think.

However I do not know how hard it is to get a job in this area( I know they are limited). Is this a career that is good to directly pursue? Or should I focus on medicine / pharmaceuticals ( which I also like, maybe not quite as much), because there are also more jobs in these, and keep astrobiologist in the background.

The California Nebula (Multiple nights of imaging with a camera and telescope),"&amp;#x200B;

This vibrant beauty starts out high in the sky at nightfall at this time of year (In the northern hemisphere). If you can locate Pleiades, NGC 1499 is not far away. 

I remember gasping as I watched the exposure finish on my (newly modified) DSLR through an 80mm telescope the first time I photographed this nebula.

[The California Nebula captured from my backyard in the city \(Bortle Class 8\)](https://i.redd.it/kvoj5s3cqke21.jpg)

Several years, and countless imaging sessions later, and I still travel back to that moment whenever I see it. 🌌

This image features a mash-up of data from multiple cameras and telescopes (I know, helpful right?).

The majority of data was captured using the Meade 70mm Quad refractor with my  Canon T3i for color, with some much needed Ha details thrown in, including data shot in October through an Esprit 100 with a duo-narrowband filter.

I went TO TOWN on the processing. As a whole, I love it - but in reality the stars are little chewed.

Where could I find a list of real star data to simulate an HR Diagram with my astronomy students?,"Hello /r/Astronomy 

I'm planning to make an activity for my students that consists of a blank log-log graph, and each one of them has one or a couple of stars, along with its properties. And one by one they begin charting the real stars to hopefully reach the same conclusions of the stellar evolution (Main sequence, giants, etc.). I think it would be a fun task for school level kids.

I have thought of generating the list in python with some simulated data that ressembles the HR, but I think it is better if I can directly download real stellar information. They are about 300 kids, so I think a list of that length would be enough.","Where could I find a list of real star data to simulate an HR Diagram with my astronomy students? Hello /r/Astronomy

Need help understanding Newtons The Crime of Ptolemy,"Hi everyone.  
I am writing a paper for University about the fraud-allegations against Ptolemy over time. I am a history student and dont know much about astronomy.  
Right now i am reading The Crime of Ptolemy by R.R. Newton and there is this passage i don't understand. Here he wants to proof that Ptolemy fabricated some of his observations. He proposes the following method:  


First we locate genuine observations made by other astronomers that are relevant to the theories that Ptolemy wants to establish with the aid of his own observations. Next we find the parameters in Ptolemy's theories by using the observations made by others, and we calculate the **circumstance** of Ptolemy's alleged observations from his theories, using these parameters to do so. Finally we compare the calculated **circumstances** with those which Ptolemy claims to have observed. In many cases, the calculated and ""observed"" **circumstances** agree to every digit that Ptolemy writes down. \[...\]  


What does circumstance mean here?   
Is it like a astronmy-specific term? I googled that and could not find anything.  
English is not my native language, maybe this could be the problem too, but all the translations of circumstance dont make any sense in this context.

Expanding Universe?," 

Explain it like I'm 5.

I don't know anything about astronomy/astrophysics, but a question came to me today about the expanding universe while watching Joe Rogan get mentally wrecked by Brian Cox. How do we know, or what reason do we have to believe, that the universe is expanding? In what direction and away from what focal point? Can we point to a position in the sky and say ""there, that's where all the stuff is moving away from""? Or do we just see all things moving in one direction ""away"" from some indeterminate ""X"" position?

But my real question is how could we deduce that that is, in fact, a focal point or ""wave-in-one-direction"" if all we have is the observable universe? Couldn't we just as easily say that the observable universe is expanding as one among, perhaps, millions of other either centrifugal ""bubbles"" or waves (or whatever) within the larger universe?

Sorry if my question is dumb or naive. But it is genuine.","Expanding Universe?

I am working on a piece of writing depicting an amateur astronomer who is conducting the test on a 8 inch refractor that they have been machining. 

I've been reading up on it but most of what I have found has been fairly technical so I was wondering if anyone could explain this to me in really simple terms. How does the test work, what does it prove, and what can interfere with getting an accurate result?

Would looking at the stars make people more curious about space?,"I live in Montgomery County Maryland and when I look up into the suburb skies on a clear night the most I can see are a faint 100-200 stars. It’s beautiful even though there are so little but I was wondering. If people looked up and saw hundreds of stars and smoke beautiful colors would that make more people interested  in space? It’s sometimes easy to forget that we’re not invincible on the floating rock, and we really are just on a rock drifting around. I think if people could look up and see some more stars it would naturally make more people curious. What do you think? If so would that naturally improve space programs with more people interested in funding/ working around something that has to do with space?

6mm Eyepiece recommendations?,"New to astronomy.  Always wanted a scope and finally got one. I'm running acelestron nexstar 4se. I'm learning the process, so be patient. 

As far as I can tell it has a focal length of 1300mm, and maximum usablemagnification of 240x.  

A 6mm eyepiece would get me about 216x. I an looking for a planetary level eyepiece. I saw a recommendation for a Williams's Optics EP, but it doesn't look too be produced anymore (12.5 mm only).

Any recommendations? I have also been looking at Agen and Orion EPs. I would like to keep org midrange cost, no more than $70-80.

"Need anyone with a &gt;5 inch telescope from Washington/northern Idaho/Wyoming for an occultation on 2019/02/16, no experience required!","Hey everyone, after the (somewhat successful) observation of the asteroid 2015 TG387 on October 20, I would like to once again ask publically if anyone is interested and available to observe a new object: the unusual asteroid 944 Hidalgo. Just to give some background, it's a very strange asteroid whose orbit takes it from just inside the asteroid belt to almost the orbit of Saturn. It has a strangely comet-like orbit, and scientists think that it used to be a comet at some point that already lost all of its ice and dust.

In the early morning of February 16, just after it reached its closest point to the sun in October, Hidalgo will appear to pass almost exactly in front of a 10th-magnitude star, blocking its light out for up to 5 seconds in a phenomenon called an occultation. By observing it and measuring how long the light remains blocked out for, we can construct the apparent shape of the asteroid to a much higher accuracy than any other method can give us except just flying a spacecraft over.

It's currently thought that Hidalgo might be a contact binary, like the recently explored 2014 MU69/Ultima thule, but that can't be confirmed until we can tell what its shape is, something that the 2019/02/16 occultation could tell us if we get enough observers.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the asteroid's fairly small size (about 50-60 kilometers), the 'shadow' it will cast from the star is only 50-60 kilometers across, and extends over a small area of Vancouver island, northern Washington, northern Idaho, southern Montana, and Wyoming, before its shadow passes over the eastern US, where dawn will already be starting. Is anyone in that area available to get up around 5:30 AM on February 16 to help us learn more about the nature of the asteroid Hidalgo?","Need anyone with a &gt;5 inch telescope from Washington/northern Idaho/Wyoming for an occultation on 2019/02/16, no experience required!

Ancient Astronomy. Interesting Stories and Facts?,"Okay. I'm trying to write a book on Astronomy, and how it has evolved over the years. And I've got some solid content on the Middle section, (with Galileo, Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, etc) and Modern Astronomy, with Relativity, Stephen Hawking and his work on Black Holes, and Carl Sagan.

I'm struck with what to write in the Early Astronomy section. I know it was mostly studying constellations, and geocentric theories by a lot of Greek, Arab, and Indian philosophers.  Some philosophers came up with early evidence of Spherical Earth and Heliocentrisim. But what I'm struck with, is that I'm not able to find any particularly interesting stories to being with.

Are there any interesting stories with any person coming up with constellations, or studying them? 

I'm not finding any good event or story like that to start off the book. 

I need to do research if I have to get somewhere with the book, and I'm willing to do that.  Can anyone give some pointers on where to research?
