A gift for my great and very inspiring phyics teacher,"So as the title says I’m looking for a gift for my physics teacher that has gotten me really into physics to the point where I’m considering being a physics teacher as a real job option. Since it’s my last year and also his last year because he’s going into retirement I wanted to give him something special. Something that will last and be kind of like a cool trinket of my thankfullness and aspiration. 

I would want it to be something that a physics teacher could enjoy. Mostly something that is in some way related to physics or a cool mechanical item is the things I’ve thought about the most. 

I at least know that I want it to feel substantial and not like a toy. And even though I’d like to give him something rather expensive and valuable I don’t actually want it to be that expensive. Mostly just because I wouldn’t want him feeling bad about receiving something that cost me a lot of money to acquire.

As just a bit of an add-on at the end. I do live in Sweden but I’m willing to pay for shipping if it isn’t too too expensive!

Is it true that the days of revolutionizing physics with just a pen and notepad are long over?,"So what happened today was that me and my engineering mechanics professor (yes I am an engineer but I might switch to physics later on) were discussing about my idea of doing masters in physics after my B.Tech.

LHCb discovers new pentaquarks,"I've been itching to post this all morning, and since the only public link I can find is from a website that's banned from this subreddit, I have to make a text post.

In a 1D analysis of m(J/ψ p) from Λb→J/ψ p K using the full Run1+2 LHCb dataset (9× more data than before), the previously-reported Pc(4450) is found to actually be 2 narrow states at 4440 and 4457 MeV, and an additional new state is seen at 4312 MeV.

The broad Pc(4380) state was found to be necessary in the Run 1 analysis under the assumption that there was only one peak at 4450 MeV, but with the discovery that this is actually two peaks, the motivation is no longer there.
A full amplitude analysis is necessary to see whether the Pc(4380) is really there or not, but this is challenging and will take longer.

"QCD and Yang-Mills vacua, and the concept of vacuum fluctuations.","I just finished my introductory QFT course and am still confused about the nature of vacuum fluctuations.

In pop-sci books, vacuum fluctuations are presented as the virtual particle pair production allowed due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The Wikipedia article (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) follows the same logic.

However, comments here and on stack exchange (e.g. https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/257035/confusion-in-understanding-of-quantum-fluctuations-and-vacuum-energy) often propagate the nation that this simple picture is wrong entirely. Virtual particles are just ja mathematical tool und misinterpreted by science communicators (and partially by particle physicist) as some form physical reality. Furthermore, the Casimir effect, which is traditionally the go-to example for the effects of vacuum fluctuations, is not supposed to be any evidence of fluctuations. The Wikipedia article on the Casimir effect even states that there are no experimental tests of vacuum fluctuations at all.


So I was satisfied with this answer. Vacuum fluctuations are just another misrepresentation of QM in pop-sci and that's okay. However, further investigation still left me puzzling. For example, there seems to be active research in the non-perutuative vacuum of Yang-Mills theories and QCD in particular. Derek Leinwebers work (http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/theory/staff/leinweber/) for example suggest that the QCD vacuum is a dynamical, fluctuating state. This paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0407084) also states that the QCD vacuum has a non-trivial, dynamical gauge field background. In general, background field methods and the study of instantons in the context of QCD seem to suggest that the gauge fields undergo dynamical fluctuations. Additional, I found this paper on measurements of zero-point fluctuations in Josephson junctions: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1216. And finally, I'm taking a course on fluctuation-induced phenomena next semester and part of the course outline are the Casimir- and Casimir-Polder-effects.

All of this leaves me rather confused. Can someone explain to me in what sense vacuum fluctuations are a legitimate concept in QFT?

Metamaterial computer solves integral equations encoded in electromagnetic waves,,Metamaterial computer solves integral equations encoded in electromagnetic waves 
Made the choice to go back to being a theoretical/computational physicist after a NASA contractor interview(theory can get jobs!),"So the year I applied to grad school, I also applied to several jobs. To put it bluntly the job search sort of traumatized me. I thought I had somewhat of an accomplished resume and I got rejected from nearly science/engineering/physics related job. The reason it affected me so much is that I don't have any income source other than myself. I'm estranged from my family because a lot of them are awful so it's just me.

&amp;#x200B;

So of course that got me worrying. I got student loans and all that so I started freaking about how I can pay all that off if I'm having trouble getting a job. I got accepted into grad school but I chose a research field that was much more applied for the sake of a job. I wanted to do cosmology, I wanted to work in computation/theory because that's what really interested in me and pushed for my passion in physics. Earlier this year I applied for an internship position at NASA Johnson for modelling orbital debris and got an interview. The interviewers really enjoyed my theoretical/computational skills. A lot of the computational projects I did was exactly what they were looking for.

After realizing that I can get a job with my theory skills I immediately made the switch to a professor who does computational cosmology and I am so much happier. These past 6 or 7 months I knew in the back of my mind I was doing something that wasn't my passion and it was bothering me deep down. I know I'm only one anecdote but going through this I realize doing graduate school while not doing your passions doesn't work. I don't know what the future holds but I figure maybe just trusting that we're hard working, passionate people will help us in the end. There's my story for anyone who is worrying about a job and might be wondering about going into theory","Made the choice to go back to being a theoretical/computational physicist after a NASA contractor interview(theory can get jobs!) So the year I applied to grad school, I also applied to several jobs. To put it bluntly the job search sort of traumatized me. I thought I had somewhat of an accomplished resume and I got rejected from nearly science/engineering/physics related job. The reason it affected me so much is that I don't have any income source other than myself. I'm estranged from my family because a lot of them are awful so it's just me.

&amp;#x200B;

So of course that got me worrying. I got student loans and all that so I started freaking about how I can pay all that off if I'm having trouble getting a job. I got accepted into grad school but I chose a research field that was much more applied for the sake of a job. I wanted to do cosmology, I wanted to work in computation/theory because that's what really interested in me and pushed for my passion in physics. Earlier this year I applied for an internship position at NASA Johnson for modelling orbital debris and got an interview. The interviewers really enjoyed my theoretical/computational skills. A lot of the computational projects I did was exactly what they were looking for.

"PhD-holding physicists of Reddit, was it worth it?","I've seen a lot of posts in the last few days ragging on getting a PhD, and I'd kind of always assumed I would get one (more education = more expertise = better job, right?)

Physics &amp; Economics: Ideas on how one could model the dispersion of a substance in a fluid?,"I am an economist and I have to carry out a macroeconomic research for which I pretty much have carte blanche regarding the topic. I believe that the greatest innovations are found at the meeting points between subjects, hence this idea.


Empirical research shows that once countries/regions remove capital/cultural/legal barriers their GDP per capita between these regions tends to converge. My idea is to model the dispersion of capital/GDP as if it was a substance immersed in a liquid: vats with a greater concentration will diminish their concentration of said substance at a certain rate depending of certain factors (I assume, density, temperature, viscosity, pressure, etc.) when put in contact with lower concentration ones until the two have the same concentration and vice versa.


My question therefore is: is there a way I could model this dispersion? Has anything similar been done in physics/engineering?


Any suggestion helps, thanks in advance!","Physics &amp; Economics: Ideas on how one could model the dispersion of a substance in a fluid?

"Anyone want to read Griffiths ""Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"" and do weekly/bi-weekly discussion threads?","So, I just started reading it recently, and I thought it would be cool to start a little reading club-type thing with this sub. I feel like it would be a good way to hold myself accountable and also encourage some nice discussion in here. Plus I just want to talk about it with people!

If anyone is interested in quantum but never took the jump to actually learning it, now is your chance! In the preface, Griffiths says all you really need math-wise is calculus and some understanding of linear algebra.

We can do weekly/bi-weekly threads for each chapter, maybe mods can get involved if they want :)

Let me know if you're interested!!


Edit: holy crap this blew up!! I absolutely did not expect this kind of response!! This is awesome.

First thing I want to do is take a poll of how frequently we want to do this. Here's a link https://linkto.run/p/JSIDPFV9. Personally, I'm leaning towards bi-weekly because I know we all have classes/work/life, but I'm curious about the general consensus. I'd say Saturday is probably a good day to do this, so I want to say that our first post (chapter 1) will be next Saturday or the one after :) We can also maybe split the chapter half and half, like 1.1-1.3 next Saturday and the rest of chapter 1 on the following week (just added that option to the poll). 

If anyone has any advice on running this kind of thing or wants to help, please do not hesitate to let me know!! Also any input is welcome!! 

Edit 2; Also, I think people bring up a good point that griffiths doesn't teach bra ket, so I made a poll for which book we will be using https://linkto.run/p/2Z9PID6P. If anyone has any to add, let me know. But, I really don't mind using Griffiths if the general consensus is keen on using that one!","Anyone want to read Griffiths ""Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"" and do weekly/bi-weekly discussion threads?

Statistical Mechanics is awesome,"My introduction to statistical mechanics was in a great book called One, Two, Three Infinity by George Gamow. It's ironic because that was the chapter I was looking forward to the least, but it turned out to be the one that influenced me the most. I haven't taken many physics courses yet, so I don't have the mathematical methods to understand a lot of physical phenomena. I guess it helps I took a probability course, but still, statistical mechanics seems to be the most practical branch of physics I've encountered in the PoP ScIeNcE books I've read. I've thought about so many situations in a new light since then.

Tonight was the most beautiful one for me yet though. I stepped in a puddle of cold water and couldn't get home for like 30 min. So worried about frostbite, I looked it up when I got home. I found out that your skin loses heat 25-30 times faster in water than air. Which instantly made sense when I thought about it from a probabilistic standpoint. Well heat is just the kinetic motion of the molecules jiggling around and heat flows from hot to cold. Also, in a given volume of water there will be more molecules than in a given volume of air, aka it is denser So there is a much greater chance that any water molecule will interact with a molecule in my skin, carrying away kinetic energy. Thus many more interactions will occur, carrying my heat away faster.

To be able explain so many physical phenomena with relatively little mathematics, it just seems like such a powerful tool.","Statistical Mechanics is awesome My introduction to statistical mechanics was in a great book called One, Two, Three Infinity by George Gamow.

"About popscience on the basis of a piece on dark matter and MOND theories, opinions?","This is a (close) translation of an audio piece I caught on German public / nation-wide radio (Deutschlandfunk) a couple of weeks ago. The show is called *Forschung aktuell*, i.e. ""current research"", and I would say this show is somewhat comparable to Science Friday with Ira Flatow, but consists of smaller daily pieces, not a longer weekly show - and with less focus on fecal transplants ;). The piece is titled ""Alternative theories of gravity are becoming respected"".

Does anyone feel like commenting on what they think about the quality / accuracy of this piece? Does it serve the listener well, is it beneficial or detrimental to the listeners understanding of dark matter-related phenomena and does it give an accurate idea of the status quo? (I'll put my view below the text.)

Here's the piece I'm refering to

---

&gt;To get started, however, we look at a dilemma that has been causing physicists sleepless nights for years. As far as the nature of the cosmos is concerned, they are stuck in a dead end because large-scale searches [for dark matter particles] have gone nowhere.

&gt;Michael Krämer: ""If you look in one direction and don't find anything, one should start looking left and right, and have an eye on alternatives.""

&gt;It's about dark matter, the stuff that most physicists believe is about 80% of matter in the universe. It is called Dark Matter because nobody knows exactly what is behind it, as nobody has yet, despite many efforts, seen the mysterious particles.

&gt;That large quantites of dark matter must exist in the depths of the universe, astronomers infer from the movements of spiral galaxies, whose arms would otherwise have to be catapulted away.

&gt;But couldn't there be other explanations for the cohesion of these structures? Of course there are. But for a long time such theories haven't been considered respectable, as almost all physicists have sided with dark matter. In the meantime this is changing, as Dirk Lorenzen has learned at a conference in Aachen on the topic of ""dark matter and alternative theories of gravity"".

&gt;Looking at galaxies in space, astronomers see that something isn't right. With matter that is visible with telescopes alone, it's not possible to explain how the enormous systems of billions of stars rotate and move through space. Either there exists a lot of dark matter in addition to the luminous matter - or the attractive force [sic], gravity, works differently to the way Isaac Newton and Einstein formulated. But, as Michael Krämer, professor for theoretical physics at RWTH Aachen says, for a long time most researchers didn't want to joggle with the laws of these luminaries:

&gt;Krämer: ""Dark matter has been the standard paradigm to date and the search, it has to be clearly said, has hitherto been unsuccessful. It's not really conclusive that it doesn't exist, but, of course, if you look in a specific direction and don't find anything, you should start looking left and right, and have an eye on alternatives.""

&gt;With dozens of experiments physicists across the world have tried to detect hypothesised dark matter particles. But there wasn't even vague indications of undiscovered particles, even though according to theory they are supposed to make up 80% of the cosmos. In experiments using the LHC collider in Geneva longingly anticipated traces of dark matter have failed to appear as well.

&gt;And thus more and more researchers are dedicating themselves to the second possibility, to understand the motion of galaxies in space. According to this, something isn't right about the well-known force of gravity - an idea brought to the fore by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom of the Weizman insitute in Rehovot in the early 80s:

&gt;Mordehai Milgrom: ""I've been of a different opinion than 'mainstream' science for a long time. I don't believe there's a lot of dark matter in galaxies. We're rather using the wrong physics. The motion of galaxies is easily explainable, if we modify gravity slightly, ie if the attractive force [sic] works slightly differently than described by Newton.""

&gt;Mordehai Milgrom has named his theory MOND, modified Newtonian dynamics. According to this the effect of the attractive force [sic] between massive celestial bodies changes, when it's very weak. In our every day life this plays no role, it does however on the edges of galaxies and the expanses of the cosmos.

&gt;The MOND theory indeed explains some phenomena better, than models with dark matter are able to - conversely it has great weaknesses when it comes to the large scale structure of the cosmos. It can't explain those yet, Milgrom: ""I always stress that we're still almost at the beginning. There's still big gaps in the theory. We have to expand it to describe the cosmos as a whole. I hope, that more people from other areas with different technical abilities will join us and provide us with new ideas.""

&gt;Dark matter is still clearly the preferred model of most researchers, thousands of scientists are working on experiments searching for these ominous particles or are simulating the structure of the world with dark matter.

&gt;However the once at best ridiculed alternative theories of gravity are being taken seriously since - and unlike in the past, research organizations are now funding projects to improve MOND theories.

&gt;Michael Krämer is looking forward to the developments of the next years with joy and suspense - because the present relative stagnation in physics can only be ended by a big step ahead: Either dark matter particles can be tracked down - or it turns out that gravity acts differently than thought:

&gt;""That would be a very very exciting form of new physics, because if these theories of modified gravity are fleshed out further, and can plausibly explain cosmological things [phenomena], then they would be attractive alternatives to dark matter. And that has direct influence on what we are researching in particle physics.""

---

Listening to the intended message of this piece (that's what the author has confirmed in an email as well), it seems to imply that ""MOND-like"" theories *are gaining support recently*, and that with a lack of detection of candidate particles for dark matter the *tide may be turning*.

I personally think in the presentation of dark matter it isn't very accurate and leaves out a lot of evidence for dark matter, whose inclusion would ""put the narrative of this piece under pressure"". You come away with the impression that dark matter is solely based on rotational behaviour of galaxies. The only other thing they mention (although briefly) is structure formation. (Subsequently, this kind of introduction to the topic forms the basis for laymen who further engage with the matter, is it a bad start for them?).

Connected to leaving out these things (say Bullet Cluster or the CMB), it then doesn't contain any critical questions regarding how the MOND-like theories that it presents deal with them, which would be interesting. Although it does mention vaguely ""great weaknesses"".

I would say it strictly stays in a subset of evidence that I would call the comfort zone for MOND theories.

Generally if I know nothing about the topic I guess what I'm taking away is, to use a figure of speech / a meme, ""dark matter is *just* a theory, there's equally viable alternatives"", or as its apparently called this piece seems guilty of [""false balance"" or ""bothsidesism""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance). Does anyone else have this feeling?

I'm also not convinced by this implied *momentum gain* for modified theories. I would think these have come under more pressure with recent observations instead (be it even LIGO). Can someone comment on this?

What do you think overall, is the piece of benefit or detriment in informing lay listeners about dark matter-related phenomena? Does it convey the right idea regarding the viability and support of MOND(like) theories in the field?

I've also emailed the authors about these points some time ago. In short

""The author has a physics degree and is aware of [the body of evidence]. There's a time limit on the piece, so we couldn't mention all the evidence for dark matter.""

""We've been reporting on new discoveries for 20 years and don't like to repeat ourselves.""

""The really new thing about the conference in Aachen was that while supporters of alternative theories of gravity have been outsiders for several decades and have barely been taken seriously, an increasing number of experts are listening to them now, because all attempts to pin down dark matter have failed so far.""

""It can't hurt at least covering alternative explanatory attempts.""

I would just want to add that I think it matters how (accurately) they are covered.

I guess this is a bit of a meta discussion about popscience using a specific example. Not sure if people are interested in this.","About popscience on the basis of a piece on dark matter and MOND theories, opinions?

""The author has a physics degree and is aware of [the body of evidence]. There's a time limit on the piece, so we couldn't mention all the evidence for dark matter.""

""We've been reporting on new discoveries for 20 years and don't like to repeat ourselves.""

""The really new thing about the conference in Aachen was that while supporters of alternative theories of gravity have been outsiders for several decades and have barely been taken seriously, an increasing number of experts are listening to them now, because all attempts to pin down dark matter have failed so far.""

""It can't hurt at least covering alternative explanatory attempts.""

I would just want to add that I think it matters how (accurately) they are covered.

I guess this is a bit of a meta discussion about popscience using a specific example. Not sure if people are interested in this."

Silicon Quantum Dot Spin Qubit Operating Above 1 K,"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09126

This new arXiv submission describes the operation of a double quantum dot spin qubit that is operated at temperatures as high as 1.45 K and magnetic fields as low as 100 mT.

This is an extremely surprising result because it shows that the qubit can be operated in a regime where its energy splitting is actually less than the thermal energy because the qubit is isolated from the 'hot' electron reservoir.

Silicon spin qubits are being developed by several commercial foundries already. These results are extremely favourable for the further development of solid-state spin qubits because it suggests that it may be possible to design devices that do not require millikelvin operating temperatures, which has been required thus far with most solid-state qubits, including superconducting qubits.","Silicon Quantum Dot Spin Qubit Operating Above 1 K https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09126

Zhores Alferov (obituary),"&amp;#x200B;

(*Zhores Alferov was a Soviet scientist an Nobel prize laureate. Among other things he made significant advance in semiconductor lasers technology which is nowadays widespread. But there is more than physics...)*

I've attended a few of Alferov's lectures and speeches - and once on contrary I was in a small group of school-kids who were congratulating him with some funny song from stage at his birthday celebration.

He also was one of the ""founding fathers"" of the ""Physical-Technical School"" in Saint-Petersburg, Russia from which I myself graduated (and where still I try to teach kids electronics once a week).

There was something special about him. Alferov was a devoted communist :)

Sometimes he was somewhat funny when he was explaining his views. But he was extremely sinsere - whole of his life.

He was a communist in a ""good meaning"" of the word. It is about idea, (like, you know, described in Acts of Apostles).

He believed that we all should have just opportunities to be happy. And besides - just opportunities for good education. Probably because he himself come from a ""working class"" of society and enjoyed Soviet educational system which was generally free at all levels.

As I know he spent a part of his Nobel Prize on creating his small Fund to help young scientists (it is important to understand that were during quite hard times of late 1990s). He spent a lot of efforts to help develop the school mentioned above - and later to found and build Saint-Petersburg Academic University.

I'm not sure what will happen to organizations he tried to create and cherish - and what direction they turn towards - such things are often ""turn awry"" - and one never can be sure.

But the good ideas should not die. We all are ""blessed"" - in the sense that due to modern era of internet it is easy to create things which help others.

Why is theoretical high energy physics so attractive today?,"I'm attending a master degree in Physics, we are about 100 people in total.

I'm into this field too, i like it since first year and my passion is never vanished.

On Radioactive Music: Gamma Spectrometry and Electronic Music Systems,"Hi! I'm a nuclear artist / sound designer I'd like to show you my work with gamma spectrometers.  
Ray of Light MCA/S is my personal software multichannel analyser/synthesizer for the sonification of X and Gamma Rays. The software works with a gamma spectrometry system made by a 1.5"" NaI(Tl) Scintillator and a spectrometer driver. The system can discriminate the photons' energies (something that geiger counters can't do), and analyse the patterns of radioactivity generated by different nuclear reactions.

Max8 was used to create a realtime MCA with integrated syntheziser and includes:

1. A pulse recognition algorithm
2. A special FFT for the analysis of the pulse heights (PHA analysis)
3. 512 realtime oscillators
4. Reverb, EQ and Delay Channels
5. 3 looping samplers for further sound processing

What is physics to you?,"Some background
Ill have been graduated for a year this coming May. I did physics with a concentration in electrical engineering. I now work as an engineer. 

To me, physics is so much more than big words and mathy equations. It's a unique way of thinking. The type of thinking that leads to understanding. The type of thinking that allows you to break down your own misconceptions and build up from a fundamental level. So, out of everything I learned in my physics classes, the thing I can't forget is how to think about things.

Software for quantum information PhD (theory),"Sorry for the slightly long and rambly post. I've recently started a PhD in quantum information and some of the things I'm looking at are

1. Tomography of quantum states based on some measurement outcomes
2. Creating small systems like 1D spin chains and finding ground states or thermal states (Tensor Networks, Matrix Product States, DMRG algorithms, etc)
3. Optimization over sets of quantum states based on some measures and constraints on the state

and so on. I'm reasonably competent with both MATLAB and Python but I'd like to get your opinion on how to go from here.

So far, I've found MATLAB easier to work with (QETLAB has great packages for quantum states and operators) and I think MATLAB has some good optimization software like CVX. But particularly for point 2), I noticed that Tensor Networks and DMRG algorithms and similar stuff on GitHub are written mostly in Python. I'm struggling with optimization in Python and making it work together with QuTiP, for example.

Should I pick one from MATLAB and Python and do all my work on it or keep using both, depending on the problem? If I should go with Python, what packages would you recommend for this kind of quantum info/optimization/ a bit of condensed matter type of work?

Just got home from Brian Cox's Universal Adventures in Space and Time Tour,"Hey /r/physics, I've been a lurker here but never posted before. I'm hoping such a post is allowed since it did not seem to violate any of the rules. I've just got back home from Brian Cox's tour (the show was in Manchester this evening) and on my walk back home I was just thinking about the event as a whole.


A Saturday evening in Manchester and 12,000 people of all ages and backgrounds gathered to learn a bit more about the universe we live in and hopefully leave with a better understanding of our purpose and a brief background of the universe. It was really nice to see young children, parents and even grandparents sit down for two and a half hours and listen to Brian explain Einstein's theory of general relativity and talk about black holes and how we came to exist. During the intermission this older woman sat near me was saying how she ""understood the light cones and why light travels around a black hole the way it does, but cannot figure out the reason why things are the way they are"". 


Brian truly managed to put on a show in a huge arena which could be enjoyed by both children and professors. Robin Ince's comedic touch added some humour to understanding physics (he also had a rather moving piece about watching his son's time on earth passing by) and together they managed to fuel people's curiosity. 


It's events like these that would have got me interested in physics and learning about the universe as a child. I guess I wanted to make this post to just show my appreciation towards people like Brian who successfully manage to teach, or at least pique someone's curiosity in the area of cosmology in such an entertaining manner. Physics, and sciences in general, should not only be something that is taught in a classroom or lecture theatre. 


Furthermore, the stage set up was magnificent and the simulations and animations created to back up the talk were stunning. 


If there's a show near you I highly suggest grabbing a ticket!","Just got home from Brian Cox's Universal Adventures in Space and Time Tour Hey /r/physics, I've been a lurker here but never posted before.

Why is Nikola Tesla trashed on within the scientific community?,"Disclaimer: I don't know much about him. I read a couple of articles and watched a couple documentaries on his life and accomplishment and from what I gathered:

During his early career, he did do some revolutionary work such as creating an electric generator based on Alternating Current in a society well established against the impossibility of it.

Also patented various electrical technology where although he didn't make the most money from, he did create them regardless and no doubt furthered electrical sciences which is what science is all about.

I remember learning about magnetic flux and electro-magnetism whilst in college, which he in no doubt played a major contribution alongside Faraday and Maxwell.

I will admit, his theories and ideas at the later stages of his life where a bit crazy but I don't understand why people don't give him the credit where it's due for his earlier work.

I in no doubt think he's anywhere near Einstein, Maxwell or Newton in terms of contribution to science but still; I wouldn't label him as a non-scientist as many do nowadays.

[Meta] Would you be for or against creating a /r/physics self-teaching guide?,"Hi all, hopeless student here.

I'll get straight to the point: reddit guides to anything are among the best, mainly due to the presence of community. Whenever I get interested in something that I wish to learn, I go to reddit to find communities which would be helpful. So far, /r/learnmath, /r/learnprogramming and /r/learnart have been wonderful. But I cannot say the same for /r/learnphysics.  
  
Learnphysics is essentially a dead subreddit, with occasional activity, where people only go to ask homework questions, which is half the purpose of the subreddit. The main purpose is missing.

This is why I believe that this sub should take the job of creating a self-teach guide. Now, there are many counterarguments against this, and the point of this thread is the discussion thereof.

I, for one, think that this is possible. My concern isn't the viability of this, but rather the level to which the self-teaching should go. I'd say the guide should cover freshman physics, which would give the learner a head start, should he choose to pursue physics.

Experiences with philosophers?,"I’m wondering what everyone’s experience with philosophers is, in terms of having dialogues with them and discussing ideas etc

The reason I ask is because I’m taking a philosophy course this semester and it’s honestly frustrating me, especially the deterministic vs non deterministic discussion. 

Now I won’t claim to be the best at physics but I’m in my 2nd year of my Bachelors and I can safely say most of the things discussed are easily debunked by your basic QM class. Almost everything is pop sci retellings of the Copenhagen Interpretation and obviously with their limited maths knowledge actually explaining what happens when e.g. the wave function “collapses” takes too much time to be useful in class. Afaik the CI is also non deterministic and this is all they’ve heard about yet still debate in favour of determinism.


I spoke with one dude at a party who was some kinda poet/philosopher combo and I didn’t understand anything of what he was talking about, something about wave-particle duality proving the existence of God

So yeah to summarise my experiences with them have been very frustrating. They love to compare themselves to mathematicians but have absolutely no rigour when it comes to fundamental physics

Do physicists look down on chemists?,"Although I am a chemist, I have a deep love for pure physics and all its complicated mathematical models of the universe, in every scale of size and energy possible. However, since I enrolled in university to become a chemist, I noticed that most of my peers absolutely loathe physics, and they suck at it too. That makes me really really sad, because not only physics is fucking awesome, but because it is the reason everything in chemistry works the way it does (chemistry is basically what happens when quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics make sweet love in a beaker).

Also, most of the chemistry undergrads and even people who are getting their phds in chemistry (where I study, at least) don't know even the most basic physics... that is outrageous, if you ask me. Eventually, it occurred to me ""wow, if even I am frustrated at other chemists for their lack of interest for physics, I can only imagine what physicists themselves think of us"".

So, give it straight to me, doc: do you guys despise chemists? I won't be happy to hear so, but if it is the case, I understand.","Do physicists look down on chemists?

The velocity dispersion of the ultra diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2 was found to be σgc=7.8+5.2−2.2 kms−1, much lower than expected from the stellar mass -- halo mass relation and nearly identical to the expected value from the stellar mass alone. This result was based on the radial velocities of ten luminous globular clusters that were assumed to be associated with the galaxy. A more precise measurement is possible from high resolution spectroscopy of the diffuse stellar light. Here we present an integrated spectrum of the diffuse light of NGC1052-DF2 obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, with an instrumental resolution of σinstr≈12 kms−1. The systemic velocity of the galaxy is vsys=1805±1.1 kms−1, in very good agreement with the average velocity of the globular clusters (⟨vgc⟩=1803±2 kms−1). There is no evidence for rotation within the KCWI field of view. We find a stellar velocity dispersion of σstars=8.4±2.1 kms−1, consistent with the dispersion that was derived from the globular clusters. The implied dynamical mass within the half-light radius r1/2=2.7 kpc is Mdyn=(1.3±0.8)×108 M⊙, similar to the stellar mass within that radius (Mstars=(1.0±0.2)×108 M⊙).

New Globular Clusters discovered: One of them has an age of 13.5 ± 2 billion years!,"There is an interesting new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08574) up on arXiv (that has been [accepted for publication in MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnrasl/slz010/5298502?redirectedFrom=fulltext)) by Denilso Camargo and Dante Minniti. These authors have discovered three new globular clusters (GCs) near the Galactic bulge. The three GCs have estimated ages of 13.5 ± 2.0 Gyrs (for Camargo 1107), 13.5 ± 1.5 Gyrs (for Camargo 1108), and 12.0 ± 1.5 Gyrs (Camargo 1109). For comparison, the age of the Universe is \~ 13.8 Gyrs, indicating that one or more of these GCs could have formed when the Universe was less than a billion years old. This is cool in its own right, but it is really cool when you compare it to tentative predictions from high-resolution cosmological simulations. But before delving into that, let us briefly go through some of the interesting properties of GCs.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is a GC? What makes GCs special and weird?

&amp;#x200B;

[The Globular Cluster NGC 2419. Credit: Adam Block\/Mount Lemmon SkyCenter\/University of Arizona](https://i.redd.it/p7i1jolxylc21.jpg)

A GC is a cluster of stars. They are approximately spherical and typically contain a million (with a factor of \~ 10 spread) stars in a region with radius of order 10 pc (\~ 30 light years) or so. An example of a GC, NGC 2419, is shown in the picture above. There are over 160 GCs in orbit around the Milky Way, most of which with properties neatly summarized in the [catalog](http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/~harris/mwgc.dat) by William Harris. Other galaxies, even dwarf galaxies, also host systems of GCs. GCs can be divided into two categories depending on how enriched with 'metals' (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) the stars are. [Most globular clusters are metal-poor](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/4/102/meta) (so-called ""blue""), having stars that are substantially less enriched with metals than the Sun. This indicates that these systems could be much older than the Sun. Indeed, the new paper referenced above presents the discovery of old, metal-poor GCs.

So where did these old, metal-poor GCs come from? This is a question that has been debated for many decades. In particular, we want to know how they formed in a cosmological context. Here are a few tantalizing clues:

* ***There is a remarkable correlation between dark matter and GCs***. In particular, if you tell me the mass of dark matter around the host galaxy, I can predict the total mass of globular clusters the galaxy host. (see e.g. [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/787/1/L5/meta), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01548) &amp; [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07831)). There is an almost linear relationship between the two, which is very strange because the relationship between the mass of stars formed in a galaxy is usually a complicated non-linear function of the halo mass.
* ***The stars in GCs have similar ages, indicating that they formed in a rapid burst of star formation***, rather than a prolonged sustained period of star formation.
* ***Metal-poor GCs have ages comparable to the age of the Universe***, indicating the existence of some mechanism of forming them early on.

Below I give one cosmologically motivated scenario for the origin of GCs that can explain these observations.

# The origin of old GCs in dark matter halos at Cosmic Dawn

The standard model of cosmology, ΛCDM, predicts that galaxies, as well as the first stars, form in much larger and more massive halos of dark matter. One scenario for the formation of GCs is therefore that they too form in dark matter halos in the early Universe. On the face of it, this would seem to be inconsistent with observations since no dark matter halo has been definitely detected around a GC (see e.g. [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7787)). However, this need not be so weird for two reasons:

1. Dark matter halos can be tidally disrupted if in orbit around a more massive body (like the Milky Way), leaving only a fraction of the dark matter left behind.
2. GCs are very dense objects, and could have radial extents that is tiny compared to the original host dark matter halo, meaning that in the region of the GC, the normal matter completely dominates over the dark matter gravitationally, making the latter hard to detect.

Thus, we are still free to entertain the idea that GCs form in small dark matter halos in the early Universe. More specifically, the ideal place would be dark matter halos with total masses between 10\^7 and 10\^8 Solar masses. The reason for this is that as halos reach this mass, the gas is shock-heated to temperatures in excess of \~ 8000 Kelvin, triggering rapid cooling of the gas (via Lyman-α emission). Because cooling is so rapid, the gas looses all pressure support and collapses in near free-fall to the center of the halo. It is there where a proto-GC could potentially form.

In a [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/823/1/52/meta) published in 2016, Taysun Kimm and collaborators explored this scenario from first principles using a sophisticated galaxy formation simulation. In particular, the simulation start from cosmological initial conditions and can zoom into regions as small as \~ 0.1 pc (\~ 0.3 light years) to resolve the formation of dense star clusters. Furthermore, given the high resolution of their simulation, feedback from stars can also be modelled from first principles (i.e. no fine-tuning of the physics to match observations). The result is neatly captured in their Figure 1, shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Credit: Figure 1 from Taysun Kimm et al. \(2016\)](https://i.redd.it/ianqr1tkcmc21.png)

As explained in more detail in the figure, the images shows snapshots of their simulations, mainly showcasing one of two halos (although the result of the second halo is also shown). Note that z is redshift, with higher z meaning earlier in the Universe's history. For reference, the age of the Universe at a redshift  z = 13.6 is only \~ 300 million years. As the halo reaches the mass where the gas is heated to \~ 8000 Kelvin, it indeed collapses towards the center. Since the gas conserves angular momentum, a gaseous disk a few parseccs across is formed at the center (see panel (e)). Near the center of the disk the density is so high that much of the gas is converted into stars before supernovae can explode and drive out the gas. After \~ 10 million years, so many supernovae go off that the remaining gas is blown out. What is left behind at the center of the halos are two GC-like objects, each with a mass \~ 0.6 million Solar masses, and sizes of \~ 1 pc.

Thus, simulations from first principle indicates that GC-like objects could form at the center of small dark matter halos early in the Unvierse! A similar high-resolution [simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04291) by Massimo Ricotti and collaborators led to the same basic result.

One caveat with the simulations by Kimm et al. is that they did not incorporate cooling by molecular hydrogen. Because of this, the gas in the disk is kept at \~ 8000 Kelvin until metals from supernovae can lead to further cooling. However, with molecular hydrogen, the gas would be able to cool down to \~ 200 Kelvin from the start (see e.g. [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/339393) and Figure 2 in [this simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02347)). This could conceivably change the mass of the cluster formed. I have done a preliminary analytical calculation from first principles(\*) and end up with the following approximate expression for the total mass of the cluster formed:

https://i.redd.it/d07zlznohmc21.png

Using the assumed star formation efficiency in the simulation by Taysun Kimm et al., using a gas temperature T \~ 8000 Kelvin, a star formation period \~ 10 million years, and a redshift \~ 13.5, the formula correctly predicts a GC mass of \~ 0.6 million Solar masses, in very good agreement with the sophisticated simulation by Kimm et al. With this sanity check out of the way, we can see the effect of lowering the gas temperature to \~ 200 Kelvin. In this case we get a predicted GC mass closer to \~ 100 000 Solar masses, which is even closer in line to the typical mass of GCs. While preliminary, this is quite promising.

Another nice thing with the dark matter scenario for GC formation is that it naturally gives rise to a linear relationship between the number (and mass) of GCs around a galaxy, and the mass of the dark matter halo hosting the galaxy. This is the outcome of hierarchical structure formation, and is predicted by good ol' extended Press-Schechter theory (as can be checked in a straightforward manner using the conditional halo mass function). Kimm et al. indeed estimates that this scenario could lead to hundreds of GCs around a halo of the mass of the Milky Way, with the relationship being linear in halo mass, as observations indeed indicate.  This makes the scenario even more promising.

While tentative, it may very well be the case that the metal-poor globular clusters you can see with an amateur telescope are old relics of intense star formation in dark matter halos at Cosmic Dawn.

# Notes

(\*) The properties of the gaseous disk was estimated from first principles, gravitational instability in the disk, and the eventual formation of stars was considered in these calculations. I'm still working on a first principle estimate for delta-t, the temporal extent of star formation after which the disk is destroyed. But here you expect to end up with something between 3 and 10 million years or so, from considerations of stellar feedback. Other properties of the GC can also be estimated, like the velocity dispersion of the stars, and the radius of the cluster.","New Globular Clusters discovered: One of them has an age of 13.5 ± 2 billion years! There is an interesting new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08574) up on arXiv (that has been [accepted for publication in MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnrasl/slz010/5298502?redirectedFrom=fulltext)) by Denilso Camargo and Dante Minniti. These authors have discovered three new globular clusters (GCs) near the Galactic bulge. The three GCs have estimated ages of 13.5 ± 2.0 Gyrs (for Camargo 1107), 13.5 ± 1.5 Gyrs (for Camargo 1108), and 12.0 ± 1.5 Gyrs (Camargo 1109). For comparison, the age of the Universe is \~ 13.8 Gyrs, indicating that one or more of these GCs could have formed when the Universe was less than a billion years old. This is cool in its own right, but it is really cool when you compare it to tentative predictions from high-resolution cosmological simulations. But before delving into that, let us briefly go through some of the interesting properties of GCs.

&amp;#x200B;

# What is a GC? What makes GCs special and weird?

&amp;#x200B;

[The Globular Cluster NGC 2419. Credit: Adam Block\/Mount Lemmon SkyCenter\/University of Arizona](https://i.redd.it/p7i1jolxylc21.jpg)

A GC is a cluster of stars. They are approximately spherical and typically contain a million (with a factor of \~ 10 spread) stars in a region with radius of order 10 pc (\~ 30 light years) or so. An example of a GC, NGC 2419, is shown in the picture above. There are over 160 GCs in orbit around the Milky Way, most of which with properties neatly summarized in the [catalog](http://physwww.mcmaster.ca/~harris/mwgc.dat) by William Harris. Other galaxies, even dwarf galaxies, also host systems of GCs. GCs can be divided into two categories depending on how enriched with 'metals' (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) the stars are. [Most globular clusters are metal-poor](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/4/102/meta) (so-called ""blue""), having stars that are substantially less enriched with metals than the Sun. This indicates that these systems could be much older than the Sun. Indeed, the new paper referenced above presents the discovery of old, metal-poor GCs.

So where did these old, metal-poor GCs come from? This is a question that has been debated for many decades. In particular, we want to know how they formed in a cosmological context. Here are a few tantalizing clues:

* ***There is a remarkable correlation between dark matter and GCs***. In particular, if you tell me the mass of dark matter around the host galaxy, I can predict the total mass of globular clusters the galaxy host. (see e.g. [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/787/1/L5/meta), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01548) &amp; [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07831)). There is an almost linear relationship between the two, which is very strange because the relationship between the mass of stars formed in a galaxy is usually a complicated non-linear function of the halo mass.
* ***The stars in GCs have similar ages, indicating that they formed in a rapid burst of star formation***, rather than a prolonged sustained period of star formation.
* ***Metal-poor GCs have ages comparable to the age of the Universe***, indicating the existence of some mechanism of forming them early on.

Below I give one cosmologically motivated scenario for the origin of GCs that can explain these observations.

# The origin of old GCs in dark matter halos at Cosmic Dawn

The standard model of cosmology, ΛCDM, predicts that galaxies, as well as the first stars, form in much larger and more massive halos of dark matter. One scenario for the formation of GCs is therefore that they too form in dark matter halos in the early Universe. On the face of it, this would seem to be inconsistent with observations since no dark matter halo has been definitely detected around a GC (see e.g. [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.7787)). However, this need not be so weird for two reasons:

1. Dark matter halos can be tidally disrupted if in orbit around a more massive body (like the Milky Way), leaving only a fraction of the dark matter left behind.
2. GCs are very dense objects, and could have radial extents that is tiny compared to the original host dark matter halo, meaning that in the region of the GC, the normal matter completely dominates over the dark matter gravitationally, making the latter hard to detect.

Thus, we are still free to entertain the idea that GCs form in small dark matter halos in the early Universe. More specifically, the ideal place would be dark matter halos with total masses between 10\^7 and 10\^8 Solar masses. The reason for this is that as halos reach this mass, the gas is shock-heated to temperatures in excess of \~ 8000 Kelvin, triggering rapid cooling of the gas (via Lyman-α emission). Because cooling is so rapid, the gas looses all pressure support and collapses in near free-fall to the center of the halo. It is there where a proto-GC could potentially form.

In a [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/823/1/52/meta) published in 2016, Taysun Kimm and collaborators explored this scenario from first principles using a sophisticated galaxy formation simulation. In particular, the simulation start from cosmological initial conditions and can zoom into regions as small as \~ 0.1 pc (\~ 0.3 light years) to resolve the formation of dense star clusters. Furthermore, given the high resolution of their simulation, feedback from stars can also be modelled from first principles (i.e. no fine-tuning of the physics to match observations). The result is neatly captured in their Figure 1, shown below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Credit: Figure 1 from Taysun Kimm et al. \(2016\)](https://i.redd.it/ianqr1tkcmc21.png)

As explained in more detail in the figure, the images shows snapshots of their simulations, mainly showcasing one of two halos (although the result of the second halo is also shown). Note that z is redshift, with higher z meaning earlier in the Universe's history. For reference, the age of the Universe at a redshift  z = 13.6 is only \~ 300 million years. As the halo reaches the mass where the gas is heated to \~ 8000 Kelvin, it indeed collapses towards the center. Since the gas conserves angular momentum, a gaseous disk a few parseccs across is formed at the center (see panel (e)). Near the center of the disk the density is so high that much of the gas is converted into stars before supernovae can explode and drive out the gas. After \~ 10 million years, so many supernovae go off that the remaining gas is blown out. What is left behind at the center of the halos are two GC-like objects, each with a mass \~ 0.6 million Solar masses, and sizes of \~ 1 pc.

The subreddit is dedicated to carrying on Richard Feynman's legacy of engaging with a wide variety of physics subfields and topics in related disciplines, and of using that hard-won understanding to make one's teaching more relevant and exciting to one's students. As such, posts will concern recent physics news and research developments, challenging concepts, and teaching strategies, and the intersection between these three areas. Advanced undergraduate or early graduate level background will generally be assumed in conversations within the subreddit, though high school students and beginning undergraduates are welcome to read along and ask questions, and may benefit from some of the discussions. The group is most appropriate for aspiring teachers and researchers seeking to improve their craft, and for experienced teachers and researchers interested in helping the new generation of physicists to develop and grow.

S-Park Electric Bike Docking Station - Someone please help me explain how bad of an idea this is,"I'm intentionally violating Cunningham's law ([https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s\_Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law)), but help me, r/Physics, you're my only hope.

""The system involves a front bike wheel with batteries which store the energy produced by the revolving wheel and through braking.

When the cyclist returns home, they park in the S-Park bike rack that’s connected to the power network and the power in the wheel is captured and used.

Roukhomovsky and Verhnjak estimate that for a rack of 30 bikes, and an average commute of 2.2 miles a day, about one kilowatt-hour per day could be generated.""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not an engineer, but even I know that the math for this must be wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions I have:

1. Adding resistance to the forward motion of the wheel of the bike will make the UX super unpleasant. How many watts could you realistically produce with people trying to get to/from work, not in a gym ready to sweat?
   1. I did think about using only braking power - you could brake front wheel only, and it would barely slow you down but maximum recharge, and then add rear brake if you really need to stop... but that has safety implications if you can't stop in time.
2. Can you store enough energy to be relevant + the generator tech in something the size of that hub?
3. Issues with connecting the bikes (unstable/variable power supply) to a utility grid (same problem wind renewables have)

What have I missed?

  
I work in journalism and media and my editor wants to do a piece on this... I don't really want to spread something that seems so far removed from the laws of physics.

"""How we can BEAT climate change"" - Dr Simon Clark (YouTube Video)","# [Dr Simon Clark - How We Can BEAT Climate Change!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkbuV_a-rvs)

&amp;#x200B;

Great new YouTube video by *Dr Simon Clark* (YouTube Science Communicator) analysing climate change and informing the general public with genuine scientific evidence of climate change and how we, as occupants of the Earth, can help towards stopping and reversing the effects of climate change.

&amp;#x200B;

Simon has a PhD in Atmospheric Physics from the University of Exeter in the UK, and I think he's put it to great use in this video! I particularly like how he has emphasised how deep the issue is ingrained into our everyday lives in many ways, and there is no one single solution but more a collective of ""semi-solutions"".

Its weird because the supersonic flow will occur in diverging part which means the exit of the nozzle expands from the entry. 

Its why rocket engines are bellshaped rather then say a pressure washer which increases pressure by decreasing the area of the exit of the nozzle.

New open source toolkit for solving the Einstein field equations. Enjoy!,"To: Students / Researchers / Software Engineers / Physicists

My name is Michael, I am a software engineer / physicist and in the past 2 months since I first familiarized myself with Sympy, I have been leveraging its tools it to develop a toolkit for analyzing the Einstein field equations; I called it ""spacetime-toolkit"". I was really surprised by Sympy's power. I originally developed the spacetime-toolkit for research purposes but once I realized Sympy's capabilities, I figured it could be useful for anyone who was interested in exploring the Einstein field equations. It is small but powerful and accessible.

You can find the repo at [**https://github.com/spacetimeengineer/spacetime-toolkit**](https://github.com/spacetimeengineer/spacetime-toolkit)

Essentially for any metric tensor input, any coefficient associated with the connection, Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, Einstein tensor or Stress Energy tensor can be computed quickly.

The ""example.py"" file demonstrates the functionality suite. Enjoy!

My first paper! Fuzzy Dark Matter at Cosmic Dawn: New 21-cm Constraints,"So my first paper, together with Raghunath Ghara and Garrelt Mellema, is now finally [up on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09760)! :D We have also submitted it to *JCAP* (Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics). In the paper we place new constraints on fuzzy dark matter (FDM), a model of dark matter that has recently attracted lots of interest (for a recent in-depth review, [see this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08297)). The new constraint is based on 21-cm cosmology and rules out FDM as a solution to the problems that motivated it in the first place. This could be taken as further evidence for the standard model of cosmology, ΛCDM, that is based on cold dark matter. So let us go through this in a little more detail (skip the two first sections if this is already familiar to you, or check out [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/FuzzyDarkMatter/status/1078142898313547776) for a shorter version\*):

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Fuzzy Dark Matter?**

FDM was proposed [back in 2000](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003365), and postulates that dark matter is really made up of ultra-light particles, with masses \~ 10\^(-22) eV (this makes the electron mass, 5.11 x 10\^(-5) eV, look huge!). The original motivation for such a small particle mass was that it could solve challenges to ΛCDM on relatively small scales (&lt; Mpc). These challenges were:

* The observational evidence for constant-density cores at the centers of dwarf galaxies, with extents up to \~ 1 kpc (\~ 3000 light years).
* The seeming prediction (from simulations of ΛCDM) that the Milky Way should be surrounded by a large population of dwarf galaxies, like bees around a beehive. Observations indicate far fewer dwarf galaxies than one naively expects.

For an up-to-date review of these potential problems, see [this review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04256). FDM solves these problems because the exceedingly small particle mass leads to FDM behaving more wave-like *over astronomical scales*! I want to stress this: FDM has such a small particle mass that the concept of an FDM particle makes little sense. Their wave functions overlap and have extents that are comparable to the size of dwarf galaxies! This leads to a sort of resistance to confinement (basically due to the uncertainty principle) that suppresses structure formation on small-scales that would otherwise might lead to a Universe teeming with too many dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, by essentially the same effect one can explain the observed constant-density cores.

It is non-trivial that FDM manages to address these problems with one free parameter (the particle mass). Warm dark matter, which has also been invoked to explain the seeming overproduction of dwarfs, [can't explain both problems simultaneously](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1282).

Further motivation for FDM, as outlined in the review article cited at the beginning, comes from particle physics. It turns out that string theory can naturally give rise to FDM, and a coincidence whereby the particle mass favoured by the astrophysical arguments above gives rise to the correct dark matter abundance. All of this makes FDM a really interesting model, and the question becomes how to test it.

**What is 21-cm Cosmology?**

&amp;#x200B;

21-cm cosmology makes use of the [21-cm line of neutral hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line). In the early Universe, following recombination, the (baryonic) Universe was composed mainly of neutral hydrogen until it was reionized by the first population of galaxies (when the Universe was only \~ 900 million years old). Cosmic Dawn is the epoch following the Dark Ages when the first stars and galaxies formed, and started to have a significant impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). The 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen in the IGM is particularly sensitive to the presence and abundance of various astrophysical sources in the early Universe. The first stars and galaxies can both ionize (by UV emission) and heat (by X-ray emission) the IGM, and both effects can be probed by studying the 21-cm line. It is in this sense that 21-cm cosmology promises to offer us a glimpse of the first stars and galaxies, a poorly understood epoch.

Since the first stars and galaxies are expected to form in low-mass halos of dark matter  —  precisely the kind that are near absent in FDM  —  21-cm cosmology also offers us a way of stringently test our understanding of dark matter. This is where our new paper, as well as a couple of others, come in.

Earlier this year, and to our surprise, a [new paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25792) appeared in Nature by Judd Bowman and collaborators that presented the results of the EDGES low-band experiment, one of many experiments looking for the sky-averaged 21-cm signal. They claimed to have detected the long-saught signal, which was very exciting. If the signal is genuine, it implies the existence of stars already some \~ 100 million years after the Big Bang. [As was shown](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01253) shortly after, this is inconsistent with FDM, which predicts a delayed formation of the first stars and galaxies because of the near-absence of low-mass dark matter halos.

However, the EDGES signal is not necessarily consistent with ΛCDM, since its amplitude was completely unexpected — in fact impossible to reproduce in models used in preceeding years. Furthermore, its shape is that of a flattened Gaussian, rather than a more Gaussian signal predicted by ΛCDM simulations. Finally, [some concern](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01421) has been raised about the foreground modelling used by Bowman et al. Given this, constraints on FDM assuming that the EDGES signal is a genuine detection lie on shaky ground until the EDGES signal is independently confirmed (other experiments, like LEDA, is attempting to do this).

&amp;#x200B;

**Our paper and its implications for FDM**

&amp;#x200B;

Our paper, a year in the making, builds on [my BSc thesis](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1195402&amp;dswid=_e_1dAl) from last year on using 21-cm cosmology to constrain FDM. We have improved the modelling, and during the process one of us (Raghunath) discovered a useful [observational constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07774) by EDGES high-band (not to be confused with EDGES low-band discussed earlier), which focuses on a slightly later epoch (= frequency range) than EDGES low-band. Narrow 21-cm signals are easier to detect than broad ones, and EDGES high-band had not detected any narrow signal at all. Specifically, it had constrained its full width at half maximum to be approximately Δz &gt; 4 (at 2σ). Our nominal simulation of the 21-cm signal in ΛCDM produced a signal with Δz \~ 6, consistent with EDGES high-band. However, all our nominal ΛFDM simulations produced signals with too small Δz. The contrast in Δz is seen in the right-hand panel below:

[Figure 3 from our paper. The right-hand panel shows how narrow the ΛFDM 21-cm signals \(non-black lines\) are compared to the 21-cm signal in ΛCDM.](https://i.redd.it/qx2m7m50rt621.png)

&amp;#x200B;

This would rule out particle masses \~ 20 times larger than the particle mass needed to address the problems that motivated FDM in the first place. However, many parameters can be varied, so we conducted a sensitivity study and found that a more conservative constraint is \~ 6 times larger than the astrophysically motivated particle mass.

As noted, this is far larger than what is needed to explain the problems that made FDM attractive in the first place. For example, the radial extent of density cores [scale as](https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.7762) 1/particle mass, so our constraint imply density cores at most \~ 1/6 the size of what is needed. One can also argue that with a particle mass this big, FDM cannot explain the dearth of dwarf galaxies in the local Universe. Given this, ΛFDM loses all of its appeal. FDM is a really cool and exotic dark matter model, but unfortunately it does not seem to describe the real Universe. We also simulated fluctuations in the 21-cm signal and found that any detection of the 21-cm signal at high redshifts (&gt; 14 or so) by the [Square Kilometer Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array) could reinforce this conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes**

\*: Yes, I know my twitter is dead, I barely know anyone using twitter. :P","My first paper! Fuzzy Dark Matter at Cosmic Dawn: New 21-cm Constraints So my first paper, together with Raghunath Ghara and Garrelt Mellema, is now finally [up on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09760)! :D We have also submitted it to *JCAP* (Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics). In the paper we place new constraints on fuzzy dark matter (FDM), a model of dark matter that has recently attracted lots of interest (for a recent in-depth review, [see this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08297)). The new constraint is based on 21-cm cosmology and rules out FDM as a solution to the problems that motivated it in the first place. This could be taken as further evidence for the standard model of cosmology, ΛCDM, that is based on cold dark matter. So let us go through this in a little more detail (skip the two first sections if this is already familiar to you, or check out [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/FuzzyDarkMatter/status/1078142898313547776) for a shorter version\*):

Building a half-mile long photogate and fighting diffraction,"Last night I tried this for the first time over 1000ft as a test and it wasn’t a resounding success, so I figured I’d consult the ~~Internet~~Reddit hivemind! I’ve got a laser that I want to use to measure a straight line (preferably within about a millimeter) over about 2000 ft. My first thought was to focus my laser better and bring up a card until it cut the beam completely, but focusing down to a millimeter point so far away feels pretty unachievable.
Instead I put a tiny speck of retroreflective film up at the far end and raised a card through the beam till the shadow of the card stopped the light from hitting the reflector. In a world with ballistic light this would work perfectly, but unfortunately we live in a world with diffraction, so if you set the card partway through the beam and walk to the end to look at it, the “shadow” of the card is super fuzzy and has diffraction fringes around it, decreasing the accuracy of my measurement.

(unless that first order fuzziness is actually linear with distance to the target and I’m not actually losing accuracy at the card? It’s hard to tell)

I’m now imagining using a moderately narrow (1mm) slit instead of an edge and moving it up and down until the reflected light is brightEST, but I feel like there should be a better, more precise way. Does anybody have any thoughts?

Why Stars are Parsecs Apart: Estimating the characteristic distance between stars from first principles,"&amp;#x200B;

[Photo by: Jonatan Pie](https://i.redd.it/byji07tqrv421.jpg)

The nearest star besides the Sun is Proxima Centauri, located \~ 1.3 parsecs (pc) away from the Sun (or, equivalently, \~ 4.2 light years). The parsec is a characteristic distance between stars in galaxies like the Milky Way, and it ultimately determines why the night sky looks the way it does. Out of curiosity, we can then ask whether we can derive this characteristic distance from first principles. By ""first principles"" I mean the ΛCDM model of cosmology that underlies our understanding of galaxy formation.

It turns out that it is possible! Below I have included a fairly short order-of-magnitude estimate I have made, showing that you indeed end up with a characteristic distance of \~ 1 pc between stars. This figure emerges out of a combination of astrophysics and initial conditions ultimately set by inflation, a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang. After the calculation I provide some qualitative explanations of the derivation.

**THE ASTROPHYSICS**

&amp;#x200B;

Galaxies form as baryons (i.e. ordinary matter) radiate away energy and collapse within much more massive dark matter halos. As the collapse proceeds, conservation of angular momentum makes the gas rotate faster and faster, ultimately leading to the formation of a galactic disk. The characteristic radius of this disk (R\_disk) is proportional to the radius of the dark matter halo (R\_vir), with the proportionality constant being \~ λ, the so-called **spin parameter**.^(1) The spin parameter is a measure of the angular momentum of the baryons. It would be of order 1 if dark matter halos were rotationally supported, but since they're not, it tends to be much smaller than 1. Both cosmological simulations and analytical calculations back in the late 80's indicate that λ has a log-normal distribution centered roughly around λ \~ 0.04, regardless of the halo mass and redshift.^(2)

Once the gaseous galactic disk has formed, we need stars to form in it. This can only occur if the disk is gravitationally unstable to perturbations. The pressure of the gas, turbulence, and the rotation of the disk itself can prevent gravitational fragmentation into stars. In 1964, the astrophysicist Alar Toomre derived the conditions for which a disk will become gravitationally unstable.^(3) As a galactic disk becomes gravitationally unstable, stars will form, of which some will explode as supernovae. This will heat the gas and also lead to turbulence in the disk  — stabilizing it yet again as a result. Thus, stellar feedback can keep a galactic disk on the edge between stability and instability.  From Toomre's instability condition, this (together with vertical hydrostatic equilibrium) allows one to estimate the density of the disk as a function of λ and the density of the dark matter halo (see Eq. 4 in the calculation above).

&amp;#x200B;

**INITIAL CONDITIONS AT THE BIG BANG**

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing the density of the dark matter halo, we now have an estimate for the density of the disk, which in turn can be turned into an estimate for the characteristic distance between stars. But this obviously requires an estimate for the density of the dark matter halo. This is ultimately determined by density fluctuations thought to have been created by quantum fluctuations during inflation in the very early Universe. The magnitude of the density fluctuations produced by inflation determines when a fluctuations collapses and forms a dark matter halo. A halo collapsing forming early in the Universe will be denser than a one forming later, simply because the Universe was denser early on (just run the expansion backwards).

Given this, one can express the density of a dark matter halo as a function of the magnitude of the fluctuations produced by inflation, call it *Q*. Inserting this into the expression for the characteristic distance between stars, call it *d*, shows that *d* is proportional to 1/*Q*. In other words, if inflation had produced 10 times larger density fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang, then stars would be \~ 10 times closer to each other. Thus, the conditions in our corner of the Milky Way today reflects to some extent the exotic conditions during inflation.

Misplaced satellites provide highest accuracy yet of Einstein’s theory,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/xdttd7s03e321.jpg

[by Kerry Hebden](https://room.eu.com/contributors/Dr-Kerry-Hebden)

A pair of Europe’s Galileo satellites that have fortuitously been stranded in an incorrect orbit for a few years, have helped scientists achieve the most accurate measurement ever made of gravitational redshift; a key element of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, that describes how time passes more slowly when close to a massive object.

Einstein theorised that shifts in gravity would alter the passing of time a century ago and since then, several experiments have proved this to be the case. However these new findings improve upon the measurement fivefold.

These extraordinary results have been made possible thanks to the very high stabilities of passive hydrogen maser (PHM) clocks aboard each Galileo. These particular ones are stable to one second in three million years and if they didn’t account for gravitational redshift, i.e that they run faster in orbit than they do down on the ground, then it would only take a mistiming of a few tenths of a microsecond per day for the satellites to be off course by around 10 kilometres per day, if they were left uncorrected.

“The fact that the Galileo satellites carry passive hydrogen maser clocks, was essential for the attainable accuracy of these tests,” said Sven Hermann at the University of Bremen’s ZARM Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity.

“It is hugely satisfying for ESA to see that our original expectation that such results might be theoretically possible have now been borne out in practical terms, providing the first reported improvement of the gravitational redshift test for more than 40 years,” comments Javier Ventura-Traveset, Head of ESA’s Galileo Navigation Science Office.

The discovery is all the more gratifying, as the measurement only came about because the two Galileo satellites (5 and 6) were not where they were supposed to be. Launched back in 2014, a malfunctioning Soyuz upper stage rocket stranded the satellites in orbits that were too elliptical to be used for their intended purpose — navigation.

Despite an attempt by ESA flight controllers to raise the low points of the satellites’ orbits and make them more circular, they could not shift them enough and instead each satellite climbed and fell some 8500 kilometres twice per day.

But rather than assign the satellites to the great scrapheap in the skies, these regular shifts in height, and therefore regular shifts in gravity levels, turned a misfortunate event into a fortunate one.

“The fact that the Galileo satellites carry passive hydrogen maser clocks, was essential for the attainable accuracy of these tests,” noted Sven Hermann at the University of Bremen’s ZARM Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity. “Ongoing improvements in the processing and in particular in the modelling of the clocks, might lead to tightened results in the future.”

[by Kerry Hebden](https://room.eu.com/contributors/Dr-Kerry-Hebden)

A pair of Europe’s Galileo satellites that have fortuitously been stranded in an incorrect orbit for a few years, have helped scientists achieve the most accurate measurement ever made of gravitational redshift; a key element of Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, that describes how time passes more slowly when close to a massive object.

Einstein theorised that shifts in gravity would alter the passing of time a century ago and since then, several experiments have proved this to be the case. However these new findings improve upon the measurement fivefold.

These extraordinary results have been made possible thanks to the very high stabilities of passive hydrogen maser (PHM) clocks aboard each Galileo. These particular ones are stable to one second in three million years and if they didn’t account for gravitational redshift, i.e that they run faster in orbit than they do down on the ground, then it would only take a mistiming of a few tenths of a microsecond per day for the satellites to be off course by around 10 kilometres per day, if they were left uncorrected.

“The fact that the Galileo satellites carry passive hydrogen maser clocks, was essential for the attainable accuracy of these tests,” said Sven Hermann at the University of Bremen’s ZARM Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity.

“It is hugely satisfying for ESA to see that our original expectation that such results might be theoretically possible have now been borne out in practical terms, providing the first reported improvement of the gravitational redshift test for more than 40 years,” comments Javier Ventura-Traveset, Head of ESA’s Galileo Navigation Science Office.

The discovery is all the more gratifying, as the measurement only came about because the two Galileo satellites (5 and 6) were not where they were supposed to be. Launched back in 2014, a malfunctioning Soyuz upper stage rocket stranded the satellites in orbits that were too elliptical to be used for their intended purpose — navigation.

Despite an attempt by ESA flight controllers to raise the low points of the satellites’ orbits and make them more circular, they could not shift them enough and instead each satellite climbed and fell some 8500 kilometres twice per day.

But rather than assign the satellites to the great scrapheap in the skies, these regular shifts in height, and therefore regular shifts in gravity levels, turned a misfortunate event into a fortunate one.

“The fact that the Galileo satellites carry passive hydrogen maser clocks, was essential for the attainable accuracy of these tests,” noted Sven Hermann at the University of Bremen’s ZARM Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity. “Ongoing improvements in the processing and in particular in the modelling of the clocks, might lead to tightened results in the future.”

When the satellites are not helping to prove that Einstein was right once again, they are used as part of the Galileo search and rescue services, but the aim is still to use them for the purpose they were designed for. Once approved by ESA and the European Commission, the satellites will take their place with the other 24 active Galileo satellites, a system which cost around 9 billion euros to implement, to resume normal operations.

LHCb discovers new pentaquarks,"I've been itching to post this all morning, and since the only public link I can find is from a website that's banned from this subreddit, I have to make a text post.

In a 1D analysis of m(J/ψ p) from Λb→J/ψ p K using the full Run1+2 LHCb dataset (9× more data than before), the previously-reported Pc(4450) is found to actually be 2 narrow states at 4440 and 4457 MeV, and an additional new state is seen at 4312 MeV.

The broad Pc(4380) state was found to be necessary in the Run 1 analysis under the assumption that there was only one peak at 4450 MeV, but with the discovery that this is actually two peaks, the motivation is no longer there.
A full amplitude analysis is necessary to see whether the Pc(4380) is really there or not, but this is challenging and will take longer.

"QCD and Yang-Mills vacua, and the concept of vacuum fluctuations.","I just finished my introductory QFT course and am still confused about the nature of vacuum fluctuations.

In pop-sci books, vacuum fluctuations are presented as the virtual particle pair production allowed due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The Wikipedia article (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) follows the same logic.

However, comments here and on stack exchange (e.g. https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/257035/confusion-in-understanding-of-quantum-fluctuations-and-vacuum-energy) often propagate the nation that this simple picture is wrong entirely. Virtual particles are just ja mathematical tool und misinterpreted by science communicators (and partially by particle physicist) as some form physical reality. Furthermore, the Casimir effect, which is traditionally the go-to example for the effects of vacuum fluctuations, is not supposed to be any evidence of fluctuations. The Wikipedia article on the Casimir effect even states that there are no experimental tests of vacuum fluctuations at all.


So I was satisfied with this answer. Vacuum fluctuations are just another misrepresentation of QM in pop-sci and that's okay. However, further investigation still left me puzzling. For example, there seems to be active research in the non-perutuative vacuum of Yang-Mills theories and QCD in particular. Derek Leinwebers work (http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/theory/staff/leinweber/) for example suggest that the QCD vacuum is a dynamical, fluctuating state. This paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0407084) also states that the QCD vacuum has a non-trivial, dynamical gauge field background. In general, background field methods and the study of instantons in the context of QCD seem to suggest that the gauge fields undergo dynamical fluctuations. Additional, I found this paper on measurements of zero-point fluctuations in Josephson junctions: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.47.1216. And finally, I'm taking a course on fluctuation-induced phenomena next semester and part of the course outline are the Casimir- and Casimir-Polder-effects.

All of this leaves me rather confused. Can someone explain to me in what sense vacuum fluctuations are a legitimate concept in QFT?

Thanks in advance! ","QCD and Yang-Mills vacua, and the concept of vacuum fluctuations. I just finished my introductory QFT course and am still confused about the nature of vacuum fluctuations.

Made the choice to go back to being a theoretical/computational physicist after a NASA contractor interview(theory can get jobs!),"So the year I applied to grad school, I also applied to several jobs. To put it bluntly the job search sort of traumatized me. I thought I had somewhat of an accomplished resume and I got rejected from nearly science/engineering/physics related job. The reason it affected me so much is that I don't have any income source other than myself. I'm estranged from my family because a lot of them are awful so it's just me.

&amp;#x200B;

So of course that got me worrying. I got student loans and all that so I started freaking about how I can pay all that off if I'm having trouble getting a job. I got accepted into grad school but I chose a research field that was much more applied for the sake of a job. I wanted to do cosmology, I wanted to work in computation/theory because that's what really interested in me and pushed for my passion in physics. Earlier this year I applied for an internship position at NASA Johnson for modelling orbital debris and got an interview. The interviewers really enjoyed my theoretical/computational skills. A lot of the computational projects I did was exactly what they were looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

After realizing that I can get a job with my theory skills I immediately made the switch to a professor who does computational cosmology and I am so much happier. These past 6 or 7 months I knew in the back of my mind I was doing something that wasn't my passion and it was bothering me deep down. I know I'm only one anecdote but going through this I realize doing graduate school while not doing your passions doesn't work. I don't know what the future holds but I figure maybe just trusting that we're hard working, passionate people will help us in the end.

Cosmic-ray induced muons used to estimate the voltage differential of a thunderstorm at 1.2GV,"&gt;**Scientists used cosmic-ray induced muons to estimate the voltage differential of a thunderstorm to be a whopping 1.2GV**, which is 10 times previous estimates. The [study](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.105101) used the GRAPES-3 muon telescope in India to observe a decrease in muon flux as storms passed overhead. This decrease was due to the storm’s potential decelerating some of the muons. Storms were observed reaching potentials of 1.2GV in 6min, implying delivery of power &gt;2GW. Storms with power levels of this magnitude could offer an explanation for a mysterious phenomenon: [terrestrial gamma-ray flashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_gamma-ray_flash). These flashes of gamma-rays, typically observed via satellite, have been hypothesized to result from thunderstorms acting as electron accelerators, but until now storms had not been observed with enough power to explain the bursts. Related: cosmic ray muons have previously been used to passively “X-Ray” large objects, such as [the insides of volcanoes](https://www.slideshare.net/LuigiCimmino/the-muray-project-phddefence) and even [secret chambers in the Great Pyramid](https://www.nature.com/news/cosmic-ray-particles-reveal-secret-chamber-in-egypt-s-great-pyramid-1.22939).

The [study](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.105101) used the GRAPES-3 muon telescope in India to observe a decrease in muon flux as storms passed overhead. This decrease was due to the storm’s potential decelerating some of the muons. Storms were observed reaching potentials of 1.2GV in 6min, implying delivery of power &gt;2GW. Storms with power levels of this magnitude could offer an explanation for a mysterious phenomenon: [terrestrial gamma-ray flashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_gamma-ray_flash). These flashes of gamma-rays, typically observed via satellite, have been hypothesized to result from thunderstorms acting as electron accelerators, but until now storms had not been observed with enough power to explain the bursts. Related: cosmic ray muons have previously been used to passively “X-Ray” large objects, such as [the insides of volcanoes](https://www.slideshare.net/LuigiCimmino/the-muray-project-phddefence) and even [secret chambers in the Great Pyramid](https://www.nature.com/news/cosmic-ray-particles-reveal-secret-chamber-in-egypt-s-great-pyramid-1.22939).

Physics &amp; Economics: Ideas on how one could model the dispersion of a substance in a fluid?,"I am an economist and I have to carry out a macroeconomic research for which I pretty much have carte blanche regarding the topic. I believe that the greatest innovations are found at the meeting points between subjects, hence this idea.


Empirical research shows that once countries/regions remove capital/cultural/legal barriers their GDP per capita between these regions tends to converge. My idea is to model the dispersion of capital/GDP as if it was a substance immersed in a liquid: vats with a greater concentration will diminish their concentration of said substance at a certain rate depending of certain factors (I assume, density, temperature, viscosity, pressure, etc.) when put in contact with lower concentration ones until the two have the same concentration and vice versa.


My question therefore is: is there a way I could model this dispersion? Has anything similar been done in physics/engineering?


Any suggestion helps, thanks in advance!","Physics &amp; Economics: Ideas on how one could model the dispersion of a substance in a fluid?

"Anyone want to read Griffiths ""Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"" and do weekly/bi-weekly discussion threads?","So, I just started reading it recently, and I thought it would be cool to start a little reading club-type thing with this sub. I feel like it would be a good way to hold myself accountable and also encourage some nice discussion in here. Plus I just want to talk about it with people!

If anyone is interested in quantum but never took the jump to actually learning it, now is your chance! In the preface, Griffiths says all you really need math-wise is calculus and some understanding of linear algebra.

We can do weekly/bi-weekly threads for each chapter, maybe mods can get involved if they want :)

Let me know if you're interested!!


Edit: holy crap this blew up!! I absolutely did not expect this kind of response!! This is awesome.

First thing I want to do is take a poll of how frequently we want to do this. Here's a link https://linkto.run/p/JSIDPFV9. Personally, I'm leaning towards bi-weekly because I know we all have classes/work/life, but I'm curious about the general consensus. I'd say Saturday is probably a good day to do this, so I want to say that our first post (chapter 1) will be next Saturday or the one after :) We can also maybe split the chapter half and half, like 1.1-1.3 next Saturday and the rest of chapter 1 on the following week (just added that option to the poll). 

If anyone has any advice on running this kind of thing or wants to help, please do not hesitate to let me know!! Also any input is welcome!! 

Edit 2; Also, I think people bring up a good point that griffiths doesn't teach bra ket, so I made a poll for which book we will be using https://linkto.run/p/2Z9PID6P. If anyone has any to add, let me know.

Statistical Mechanics is awesome,"My introduction to statistical mechanics was in a great book called One, Two, Three Infinity by George Gamow. It's ironic because that was the chapter I was looking forward to the least, but it turned out to be the one that influenced me the most. I haven't taken many physics courses yet, so I don't have the mathematical methods to understand a lot of physical phenomena. I guess it helps I took a probability course, but still, statistical mechanics seems to be the most practical branch of physics I've encountered in the PoP ScIeNcE books I've read. I've thought about so many situations in a new light since then.

Tonight was the most beautiful one for me yet though. I stepped in a puddle of cold water and couldn't get home for like 30 min. So worried about frostbite, I looked it up when I got home. I found out that your skin loses heat 25-30 times faster in water than air. Which instantly made sense when I thought about it from a probabilistic standpoint. Well heat is just the kinetic motion of the molecules jiggling around and heat flows from hot to cold. Also, in a given volume of water there will be more molecules than in a given volume of air, aka it is denser So there is a much greater chance that any water molecule will interact with a molecule in my skin, carrying away kinetic energy. Thus many more interactions will occur, carrying my heat away faster.

To be able explain so many physical phenomena with relatively little mathematics, it just seems like such a powerful tool.","Statistical Mechanics is awesome My introduction to statistical mechanics was in a great book called One, Two, Three Infinity by George Gamow.

"About popscience on the basis of a piece on dark matter and MOND theories, opinions?","This is a (close) translation of an audio piece I caught on German public / nation-wide radio (Deutschlandfunk) a couple of weeks ago. The show is called *Forschung aktuell*, i.e. ""current research"", and I would say this show is somewhat comparable to Science Friday with Ira Flatow, but consists of smaller daily pieces, not a longer weekly show - and with less focus on fecal transplants ;). The piece is titled ""Alternative theories of gravity are becoming respected"".

Does anyone feel like commenting on what they think about the quality / accuracy of this piece? Does it serve the listener well, is it beneficial or detrimental to the listeners understanding of dark matter-related phenomena and does it give an accurate idea of the status quo? (I'll put my view below the text.)

Here's the piece I'm refering to

---

&gt;To get started, however, we look at a dilemma that has been causing physicists sleepless nights for years. As far as the nature of the cosmos is concerned, they are stuck in a dead end because large-scale searches [for dark matter particles] have gone nowhere.

&gt;Michael Krämer: ""If you look in one direction and don't find anything, one should start looking left and right, and have an eye on alternatives.""

&gt;It's about dark matter, the stuff that most physicists believe is about 80% of matter in the universe. It is called Dark Matter because nobody knows exactly what is behind it, as nobody has yet, despite many efforts, seen the mysterious particles.

&gt;That large quantites of dark matter must exist in the depths of the universe, astronomers infer from the movements of spiral galaxies, whose arms would otherwise have to be catapulted away.

&gt;But couldn't there be other explanations for the cohesion of these structures? Of course there are. But for a long time such theories haven't been considered respectable, as almost all physicists have sided with dark matter. In the meantime this is changing, as Dirk Lorenzen has learned at a conference in Aachen on the topic of ""dark matter and alternative theories of gravity"".

&gt;Looking at galaxies in space, astronomers see that something isn't right. With matter that is visible with telescopes alone, it's not possible to explain how the enormous systems of billions of stars rotate and move through space. Either there exists a lot of dark matter in addition to the luminous matter - or the attractive force [sic], gravity, works differently to the way Isaac Newton and Einstein formulated. But, as Michael Krämer, professor for theoretical physics at RWTH Aachen says, for a long time most researchers didn't want to joggle with the laws of these luminaries:

&gt;Krämer: ""Dark matter has been the standard paradigm to date and the search, it has to be clearly said, has hitherto been unsuccessful. It's not really conclusive that it doesn't exist, but, of course, if you look in a specific direction and don't find anything, you should start looking left and right, and have an eye on alternatives.""

&gt;With dozens of experiments physicists across the world have tried to detect hypothesised dark matter particles. But there wasn't even vague indications of undiscovered particles, even though according to theory they are supposed to make up 80% of the cosmos. In experiments using the LHC collider in Geneva longingly anticipated traces of dark matter have failed to appear as well.

&gt;And thus more and more researchers are dedicating themselves to the second possibility, to understand the motion of galaxies in space. According to this, something isn't right about the well-known force of gravity - an idea brought to the fore by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom of the Weizman insitute in Rehovot in the early 80s:

&gt;Mordehai Milgrom: ""I've been of a different opinion than 'mainstream' science for a long time. I don't believe there's a lot of dark matter in galaxies. We're rather using the wrong physics. The motion of galaxies is easily explainable, if we modify gravity slightly, ie if the attractive force [sic] works slightly differently than described by Newton.""

&gt;Mordehai Milgrom has named his theory MOND, modified Newtonian dynamics. According to this the effect of the attractive force [sic] between massive celestial bodies changes, when it's very weak. In our every day life this plays no role, it does however on the edges of galaxies and the expanses of the cosmos.

&gt;The MOND theory indeed explains some phenomena better, than models with dark matter are able to - conversely it has great weaknesses when it comes to the large scale structure of the cosmos. It can't explain those yet, Milgrom: ""I always stress that we're still almost at the beginning. There's still big gaps in the theory. We have to expand it to describe the cosmos as a whole. I hope, that more people from other areas with different technical abilities will join us and provide us with new ideas.""

&gt;Dark matter is still clearly the preferred model of most researchers, thousands of scientists are working on experiments searching for these ominous particles or are simulating the structure of the world with dark matter.

&gt;However the once at best ridiculed alternative theories of gravity are being taken seriously since - and unlike in the past, research organizations are now funding projects to improve MOND theories.

&gt;Michael Krämer is looking forward to the developments of the next years with joy and suspense - because the present relative stagnation in physics can only be ended by a big step ahead: Either dark matter particles can be tracked down - or it turns out that gravity acts differently than thought:

&gt;""That would be a very very exciting form of new physics, because if these theories of modified gravity are fleshed out further, and can plausibly explain cosmological things [phenomena], then they would be attractive alternatives to dark matter. And that has direct influence on what we are researching in particle physics.""

Listening to the intended message of this piece (that's what the author has confirmed in an email as well), it seems to imply that ""MOND-like"" theories *are gaining support recently*, and that with a lack of detection of candidate particles for dark matter the *tide may be turning*.

I personally think in the presentation of dark matter it isn't very accurate and leaves out a lot of evidence for dark matter, whose inclusion would ""put the narrative of this piece under pressure"". You come away with the impression that dark matter is solely based on rotational behaviour of galaxies. The only other thing they mention (although briefly) is structure formation. (Subsequently, this kind of introduction to the topic forms the basis for laymen who further engage with the matter, is it a bad start for them?).

Connected to leaving out these things (say Bullet Cluster or the CMB), it then doesn't contain any critical questions regarding how the MOND-like theories that it presents deal with them, which would be interesting. Although it does mention vaguely ""great weaknesses"".

I would say it strictly stays in a subset of evidence that I would call the comfort zone for MOND theories.

Generally if I know nothing about the topic I guess what I'm taking away is, to use a figure of speech / a meme, ""dark matter is *just* a theory, there's equally viable alternatives"", or as its apparently called this piece seems guilty of [""false balance"" or ""bothsidesism""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance). Does anyone else have this feeling?

I'm also not convinced by this implied *momentum gain* for modified theories. I would think these have come under more pressure with recent observations instead (be it even LIGO). Can someone comment on this?

What do you think overall, is the piece of benefit or detriment in informing lay listeners about dark matter-related phenomena? Does it convey the right idea regarding the viability and support of MOND(like) theories in the field?

I've also emailed the authors about these points some time ago. In short

""The author has a physics degree and is aware of [the body of evidence]. There's a time limit on the piece, so we couldn't mention all the evidence for dark matter.""

""We've been reporting on new discoveries for 20 years and don't like to repeat ourselves.""

""The really new thing about the conference in Aachen was that while supporters of alternative theories of gravity have been outsiders for several decades and have barely been taken seriously, an increasing number of experts are listening to them now, because all attempts to pin down dark matter have failed so far.""

""It can't hurt at least covering alternative explanatory attempts.""

I would just want to add that I think it matters how (accurately) they are covered.

I guess this is a bit of a meta discussion about popscience using a specific example. Not sure if people are interested in this.","About popscience on the basis of a piece on dark matter and MOND theories, opinions?

Silicon Quantum Dot Spin Qubit Operating Above 1 K,"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09126

This new arXiv submission describes the operation of a double quantum dot spin qubit that is operated at temperatures as high as 1.45 K and magnetic fields as low as 100 mT.

This is an extremely surprising result because it shows that the qubit can be operated in a regime where its energy splitting is actually less than the thermal energy because the qubit is isolated from the 'hot' electron reservoir.

Silicon spin qubits are being developed by several commercial foundries already. These results are extremely favourable for the further development of solid-state spin qubits because it suggests that it may be possible to design devices that do not require millikelvin operating temperatures, which has been required thus far with most solid-state qubits, including superconducting qubits.","Silicon Quantum Dot Spin Qubit Operating Above 1 K https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09126

Very short demo of Physics simulation in Unity3D,"Hello r/Physics. This is my little project. It's basically a plot of solutions to the Schrodinger equation for an electron in a hydrogen atom. The video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIhM_cyIX20&amp;feature=youtu.be, shows one particular configuration, ""0.707|3,1,-1&gt; + 0.707|4,1,0&gt;"". The spheres are a scatter plot of the probability density for the electron, which move along paths determined by the ""probability current"" (this means that the scatter plot remains valid at each point in time). Streamers are attached to some of the spheres to make the motion easier to see. Just looking for a bit of feedback. I'll do a more in-depth video soon.

This is basically an interactive version of something I did with Mathematica a long time ago.  Old video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHSluoPqank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHSluoPqank)

Zhores Alferov (obituary),"&amp;#x200B;

[Zhores Alferov as a young man](https://i.redd.it/ocnjqr2w7oj21.jpg)

(*Zhores Alferov was a Soviet scientist an Nobel prize laureate. Among other things he made significant advance in semiconductor lasers technology which is nowadays widespread. But there is more than physics...)*

I've attended a few of Alferov's lectures and speeches - and once on contrary I was in a small group of school-kids who were congratulating him with some funny song from stage at his birthday celebration.

He also was one of the ""founding fathers"" of the ""Physical-Technical School"" in Saint-Petersburg, Russia from which I myself graduated (and where still I try to teach kids electronics once a week).

There was something special about him. Alferov was a devoted communist :)

Sometimes he was somewhat funny when he was explaining his views. But he was extremely sinsere - whole of his life.

He was a communist in a ""good meaning"" of the word. It is about idea, (like, you know, described in Acts of Apostles).

He believed that we all should have just opportunities to be happy. And besides - just opportunities for good education. Probably because he himself come from a ""working class"" of society and enjoyed Soviet educational system which was generally free at all levels.

As I know he spent a part of his Nobel Prize on creating his small Fund to help young scientists (it is important to understand that were during quite hard times of late 1990s). He spent a lot of efforts to help develop the school mentioned above - and later to found and build Saint-Petersburg Academic University.

I'm not sure what will happen to organizations he tried to create and cherish - and what direction they turn towards - such things are often ""turn awry"" - and one never can be sure.

But the good ideas should not die. We all are ""blessed"" - in the sense that due to modern era of internet it is easy to create things which help others. We are encouraged to use these great opportunities to study ourselves and to teach others. Let's try to do our best!","Zhores Alferov (obituary) &amp;#x200B;

Mediocre Theoretical Physicists Make No Progress? (Jeff Bezos),"Most of you probably did not know that Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, was aiming to become a theoretical physicist while he was attending college. He acknowledged that he was not gifted in the same way that some his classmates were as far as physics was concerned, and he gave up this dream saying:

""Mediocre theoretical physicists make no progress. They spend all their time understanding other people's progress.""

How true is this statement? Does it apply to other fields as well?","Mediocre Theoretical Physicists Make No Progress?

Do you guys ever think you're just not good enough?,"It's grad school season so hearing rejections has been a bit tough, but it's also been soul and motivation crushing mainly because of my friend. I've worked harder than her and had loads of tougher things to deal with during the process and also had a better academics package than her when applying to schools. Yet, she's gotten into every top school she's applied to, while I've only gotten two, and they're not the top ones. Literally speaking, she's always gotten whatever she wanted and I've sweated really hard to only come half as close. I've been rejected from top schools, and she's been among the first wave of people accepted. At some point, I break and just wanna give up entirely because it seems no matter how hard I work, I get mediocre results so why even try? 

What do you guys do when you feel so down and useless like this?","Do you guys ever think you're just not good enough?
